<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/e3nb2r/longterm_reliability_testing/">Year 0</a> – I filled 10 32-GB Kingston flash drives with random data.<br/><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/lwgsdr/research_flash_media_longevity_testing_1_year/">Year 1</a> – Tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Re-wrote the drive with the same data.<br/>Year 2 – Re-tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Tested drive 2, zero bit rot. Re-wrote both with the same data.</p>
<p>They have been stored in a box on my shelf, with a 1-month period in a moving van (probably below freezing) this year.</p>
<p>Will report back in 1 more year when I test the third 🙂</p>
<p>FAQs:</p>
<ul><li>Q: Why didn’t you test more kinds of drives?<br/>A: Because I don’t have unlimited energy, time and money :). I encourage you to!</li><li>Q: You know you powered the drive by reading it, right?<br/>A: Yes, that’s why I wrote 10 drives to begin with. We want to see how something works if left unpowered for 1 year, 2 years, etc.</li><li>Q: What drive model is this?<br/>A: The drive tested was “Kingston Digital DataTraveler SE9 32GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive (DTSE9H/32GBZ)” from Amazon, model DTSE9H/32GBZ, barcode 740617206432, WO# 8463411X001, ID 2364, bl 1933, serial id 206432TWUS008463411X001005. It was not used for anything previously–I bought it just for this test.</li><li>Q: Which flash type is this model?<br/>A: We don’t know. If you do know, please tell me.</li><li>Q: What data are you testing with?<br/>A: (<a href="https://github.com/za3k/short-programs#prng">Repeatable</a>) randomly generated bits</li><li>Q: What filesystem are you using? / Doesn’t the filesystem do error correction?<br/>A: I’m writing data directly to the drive using Linux’s block devices.</li></ul>
