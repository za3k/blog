<p>Our house has seven people, so today I made some mail holders to put on our doors.</p>

<p>I basically had some long cardboard boxes, and cut them in half. Then I added new ends and separators in the middle.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if they’ll actually get used. Mail on the floor looks bad, but these aren’t that hot either. If you make some and want to improve the look, you can cover everything in paper or cardstock.</p>
