<p>CFAR usually designs their techniques to help people Get Stuff Done. I have a failure mode of Getting The Wrong Stuff Done, so this time through their workshop, I focused on improving techniques to explicitly have steps around pursuing the correct terminal goals (which I’ll here call “terminal goal techniques”).</p>
<p>Original technique: Goal-factor<br/>
New terminal goal technique:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an instrumental goal toward another instrumental goal.</li>
<li>Embark on that goal provisionally, while also making a plan to acquire more information about whether it’s a good idea and better plans are available.</li>
<li>Periodically re-evaluate to make sure it’s the best goal and you’re gathering information.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-234"></span>Original Technique: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEyvXQXdPDzu72Wv2j5bRfJbB7hV3zrjLMVR_T428oc/edit">Murphy-jitsu<br/>
</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a plan to achieve your goal.</li>
<li>Use pre-hindsight to ask “How did this go wrong?”.</li>
<li>Fix that. Go to 2 until fixed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Revised terminal goal technique: Murphy-jitsu with terminal goal check</p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a plan.</li>
<li>Use pre-hindsight to ask “How was I disappointed when this went as planned?”</li>
<li>Fix that. Go to 2 until fixed.</li>
<li>Use pre-hindsight to ask “How did this go wrong?”.</li>
<li>Fix that. Go to 2 until fixed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another technique: Positive murphyjitsu (“Why didn’t this go even better?”)<br/>
Another technique: Aversion murphyjitsu (“Imagine none of the positive listed factors happened. Why was it still possible?”) for cases when I can’t think about how to overcome a aversion directly.</p>
<p>Instrumental failure TAP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice executive planning fails  -&gt; Look for lack of motivation or motivation propagation</li>
<li>Notice motivation / motivation propogation fails -&gt; Look to see if the goal you’re pursuing is what you want (or exactly what you want)</li>
</ul>
<p>Technique: Exactboxing</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a thing to do</li>
<li>Set a 15-minute timer</li>
<li>Do the thing</li>
<li>If you finish early, keep doing the thing anyway. (For example, figure out how to do it better in the future or for the problem to never happen again.</li>
<li>If you don’t finish in time, stop anyway. It’s done. If you don’t know how it’s done, that’s a failure mode–you should have at most one task which takes an unbounded amount of time in your life. (I find this makes my brain accept ‘line of retreat’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Technique: Do the Obvious Thing</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask a question, for example how to pursue a goal you want achieved (I recommend a Hamming Question)</li>
<li>Figure out the most obvious solution.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that it is the most obvious solution.</li>
<li>Decide whether or not to do it.</li>
<li>If you don’t want to, contradiction. Debug steps 1,2,3,4 and see where you went wrong until they’re in accord.</li>
</ol>
<p>Theory on how to avoid lost purposes (mostly from Eliezer): Use <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Tarski">Litany of Tarski</a> a lot until you get the magic effect where you don’t start rationalizing to begin with (and generally don’t flinch away from learning about things/mistakes). Then, develop an aversion to lost purposes. The naive failure mode is to avoid noticing lost purposes if you have an aversion. (The simpler technique is <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/49d7">Alien in a Body</a>)</p>

<p>Cool stuff. I liked exactboxing and DTOT.<br/>
Murphy jitsu has potential.<br/>
The modified goal factor has a suspicious component of leaving things to future me that I don’t like a bit though.</p>
