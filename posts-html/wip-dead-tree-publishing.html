<div class="entry-content">
<p>I started work on my publishing website again (Dead Tree Publishing). The idea is to make a really, really convenient way to get a physical copy of a PDF/epub book. Think: “send me a printed copy of this mailing list / tumblr”. Right now things are looking encouraging.</p>
<p>I use a “back end” publisher who does all the actual printing, and the one I was using before charged quite a lot and wasn’t amazingly fast; I just used them because they were the only publisher who was at all up to date. Seriously, order of $100 – $200 for a 100 page book, just absolutely ridiculous levels of expensive. I’m switching over to a new publisher who can offer that same book for something like $7 (maybe $12 in hardback), which is absolutely reasonable, and with similar 2-week turnaround times.</p>
<p>First you upload a PDF:</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_149" style="width: 310px"><a href="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1.jpg"><img alt="2" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149" class="wp-image-149 size-medium" decoding="async" height="90" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-300x90.jpg" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2-300x90.jpg 300w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2.jpg 581w" width="300"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-149">Uploading a book</p></div>
<p>Then I tell you what your ordering options are (hardcover, softcover, color), and what they cost. I’m also supposed to ask you your address to ship the book, and for you to pay for it,  but those aren’t done yet.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_148" style="width: 310px"><a href="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1.jpg"><img alt="1" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148" class="wp-image-148 size-medium" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="254" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-300x254.jpg" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-300x254.jpg 300w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1.jpg 546w" width="300"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-148">Book-buying options</p></div>
<p>Hopefully in the next day or two I’ll have something up and running so people can order books, and then make it gradually nicer! I’m very excited about this website existing.</p>
