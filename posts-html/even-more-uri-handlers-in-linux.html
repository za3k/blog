<div class="entry-content">
<p>Sometimes Linux wants to open files. I mostly use the command line, so I wrote some helper programs to open things in terminals.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>open-text-file</code> opens your default text editor in a terminal. I set it as my program to open all text files.</li>
<li><code>open-directory</code> opens a terminal with that working directory. I set it as my program to open all directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theyâ€™re both available in <a href="https://github.com/za3k/short-programs?tab=readme-ov-file#open-directorytext-file">short-programs</a>. Both default to xterm.</p>
