<div class="entry-content">
<p>Today I got a variety of modern A.I. tools to work in <a href="https://github.com/za3k/ha3k-18-ai-grabbag">a python library</a>. This one is mostly install instructions, but it was useful for me, at least.</p>
<p>I took a day off after.</p>
<p>My conclusions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech synthesis runs at 400x realtime on CPU.</li>
<li>Speech recognition runs at 0.4x realtime on CPU, 60x realtime on GPU.</li>
<li>Generating chat at 0.05x – 0.5x realtime (3-30 wpm) on GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t get image generation working on my allotted time.</p>
