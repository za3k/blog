<div class="entry-content">
<p>I’ve had a couple people ask how my TODO list works, so here’s what I’ve been doing for the last few years. I have four lists in total: a calendar, a yearly list, a daily list, and a master list.</p>
<p><strong>A calendar.</strong> </p>
<p>The calendar has anything that needs to be done on a specific day. Birthday reminders, doctor’s appointments, and weekly activities like board game night or trash day. You’ve seen calendars. This is nothing interesting.</p>

<p><strong>A yearly goals list</strong></p>
<p>A yearly list of my goals for the year. I typically have 5-15 goals, and finish half of them.</p>
<p>This is mostly for motivation and focus. I don’t look at it much, and often only write it a third of the way into the year.</p>
<p>You can ignore this one.</p>
<p><strong>Daily TODO list</strong></p>
<p>A daily TODO list, written on paper. I throw it out at the end of each day, without copying anything off it. (I actually scan it, but I never look at the scans). This one I find very helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Master TODO list</strong></p>
<p>A “master” TODO list, consisting of everything I want to get done long term. I store this as a text file.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1104" decoding="async" height="1024" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop-894x1024.png" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop-894x1024.png 894w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop-262x300.png 262w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop-768x880.png 768w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop-131x150.png 131w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/todo-crop.png 943w" width="894"/></a></figure>
<p>Each task is a one-line description.</p>
<p>I sort tasks into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks that will take under an hour</li>
<li>Tasks that will take under a day (but more than an hour)</li>
<li>Tasks that will take less than a week</li>
<li>Tasks that will take more than a week</li>
</ul>
<p>At the very top is just a list of all my task numbers, so I can see how many I have in each category, and skip down to them.</p>
<p>Tasks are marked as </p>
<ul>
<li><code>[ ]</code> Unfinished</li>
<li><code>[x]</code>Finished (think ✅)</li>
<li><code>[X]</code>Cancelled (think ❌, decided not to do it)</li>
<li><code>[/]</code> Partially done (for very big tasks)</li>
<li><code>[&gt;]</code>Transferred to another system (doesn’t happen in the master TODO system, but sometimes I do this from my journal or a daily TODO list to indicate I wrote it down in the master TODO system)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I have a few special categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Urgent tasks. Sometimes I’ll have things that really need to get done soon (but not “today”, or they’d go on the daily list). Taxes often fit in here.</li>
<li>“Stuck” tasks. If I have no idea how to proceed with a task, it goes in a special category.</li>
<li>“Done” tasks. These are waiting to be archived (which is why everything you see is un-done)</li>
<li>“For fun” tasks. I try to keep a tasks which are just for fun in their own little section. Things like “learn to make ice cream”!</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to minimize subtasks, in general. If I have a big task (clean the house), I’ll try to list it as “clean the bedroom”, etc as seperate tasks. If I have to, I’ll have a big task that references separate small tasks, but it’s the exception, and usually in the “more than a week” category.</p>
<p>And that’s about all I have to say.</p>
