<li>Generate an SSL/TLS key, which will be used to actually encrypt traffic.
<pre>DOMAIN=nntp.za3k.com
openssl genrsa -out ${DOMAIN}.key 4096
chmod 700 ${DOMAIN}.key</pre>
</li>
<li>Generate a Certificate Signing Request, which is sent to your authentication provider. The details here will have to match the details they have on file (for StartSSL, just the domain name).
<pre># -subj "/C=US/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN}" can be omitted to fill in custom identification details
# -sha512 is the hash of your key used for identification. This was the reasonable option in Oct 2014. It isn't supported by IE6
openssl req -new -key ${DOMAIN}.key -out ${DOMAIN}.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN}" -sha512
</pre>
</li>
<li>Submit your Certificate Signing Request to your authentication provider. Assuming the signing request details match whatever they know about you, theyâ€™ll return you a certificate. You should also make sure to grab any intermediate and root certificates here.
<pre>echo "Saved certificate" &gt; ${DOMAIN}.crt
wget https://www.startssl.com/certs/sca.server1.crt https://www.startssl.com/certs/ca.crt # Intermediate and root certificate for StartSSL
</pre>
</li>
<li>Combine the chain of trust (key, CSR, certificate, intermediate certificates(s), root certificate) into a single file with concatenation. Leaving out the key will give you a combined certificate of trust for the key, which you may need for other applications.
<pre>cat ${DOMAIN}.crt sca.server1.crt &gt;${DOMAIN}.pem # Main cert
cat ${DOMAIN}.key ${DOMAIN}.crt sca.server1.crt ca.crt &gt;${DOMAIN}.full.pem
chmod 700 ${DOMAIN}.full.pem</pre>
</li>
</ol>
