<p>In my recent campaign, I had a handout for the players. I took it out, and on a whim, I thought <em>« a handout is boring</em> ».</p>
<p>I tore it into quarters in front of their eyes. I wrote on back of the handout pieces “<strong>5</strong>“, “<strong>10</strong>“, “<strong>15</strong>“, “<strong>20</strong>“. <em>“Make me an investigation check,”</em> I intoned in my best DM voice. “<em>I will grant you any pieces under your roll.</em>“</p>

<p>They got 23, so I gave them all four scraps. They taped it back together and got the whole handout.</p>
<p>And they remembered that handout. They told players <em>in other campaigns</em> about the handout.</p>
