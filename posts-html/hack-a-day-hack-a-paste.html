<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/paste">Hack-A-Paste</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/paste">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day05_paste">source</a>). You can upload text and share it with others.</p>

<p>Today’s project was an easy one, because I was busy. Took an hour or two.</p>
