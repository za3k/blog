<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s (catch-up) project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/homepage/v/zachary">Hack-A-Homepage</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/homepage/v/zachary">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day01_homepage">source</a>). You can enter various information about yourself, such as links to your social media, and make your own little homepage.</p>

<p>This one took about another hour. I think it’s okay, but today was definitely a “do the numbers” game to catch up. Tomorrow I want to do something more fun and new.</p>
