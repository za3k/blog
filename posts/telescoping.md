title: Telescoping
---

Sometimes I try to figure out what to do in a given week, and my first step is to think "what are my long term goals?". Then I realize I have no long-term goals. I sit down and think, "Hmm, what do I want to do with my life?" Eventually I give up, depressed, and go make breakfast or something.

Recently I tried going the other way, with much more success. I call this exercise **telescoping**. It takes 7 minutes, and is performed as follows:

1. Open a text document or grab a piece of paper. Grab a kitchen timer with an alarm, or your phone's alarm app.
2. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do today?*
4. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do this week?*
5. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do this month?*
6. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do this year?*
7. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do this month?*
8. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do this week?*
9. For one minute, answer: *What do I want to do today?*

I found this a bit enlightening. Here's an early example (I type fast):

2. Today
    - Enjoy myself, do some intention journaling.
    - Make at least a little progress on the zorchpad
    - Socialize with someone enjoyably
    - Become a little more long-term coherent
    
3. This Week
    - Work on the puzzle contest with XXX
    - Hang out with YYY
    - Get enough sleep!
    - Maybe get exercise

4. This Month
    - Make a prototype zorchpad and start carrying it around
    - Release qr-backup with no scary warnings
    - Continue to learn about electronics a bit, possibly
    - Have some kind of new social thing in my life

5. This Year
    - Get an income source where I don't have to do anything, and relax
    - Have a satisfying version of zorchpad
    - Learn electronics
    - Continue to learn programming languages
    - Spend a bunch of time chilling with friends
    - Get a boyfriend

6. This Month
    - Make a prototype zorchpad and start carrying it around
    - Keep my focus on zorchpad and intention journalling through the puzzle contest
    - Make 1 new friend --  might be hard, so at least attend social events in a more friend-condusive way

7. This Week
    - Breadboard a zorchpad
    - Hang out with XXX
    - Work on the puzzle contest with YYY. Wait, would she actually enjoy it? A: Yes!
    - Help someone with their quest!

8. Today
    - Work on breadboarding a zorchpad
    - Order zorchpad parts -- at least buffers/shift registers!
    - Write up telescoping in a blog post
    - Possibly, think about long-term planning a little maybe perhaps
    - Think about how to get sleep consistently, maybe?

I realized went from "Make progress on the zorchpad" to having a specific list of parts to order, and noticing I needed sleep. It helped me prioritize what I wanted to do.

I did this two or three times, and kept finding it helpful. I decided to find out what happened if I did it every day.

Two weeks of doing it daily, I will report: it was neither super helpful nor a waste of time?

Basically, it was pretty helpful to think through things I hadn't. The main benefit of doing this every day was keeping long-term goals in sight, but I was no longer thinking through new things much.

The most surprising thing for me was that one minute quickly became *too long*. I reduced it to 30 seconds per step.

On the one hand, it's not that helpful. On the other hand, it takes 3.5 minutes, and it's a nice way to orient to the day. So, might or might not keep doing it.
