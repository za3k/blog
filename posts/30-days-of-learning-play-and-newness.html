<!-- blogpost -->
<div class="entry-content">
<p>So I’ve decided on my next project! I’m going to spend a month learning new things. Unlike hack-a-day, where the focus was mostly on doing something every day, here I’m trying to cultivate a different attitude.  So the following are all encouraged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being curious about stuff</li>
<li>Getting distracted</li>
<li>Having fun</li>
<li>New experiences</li>
<li>Being goofy, even if I don’t “learn” anything from goof experiences</li>
<li>Naps</li>
<li>Hanging with other people</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are discouraged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completionism</li>
<li>“Grinding” through a nonfiction book I’m not that into</li>
<li>Rigorously writing up everything</li>
<li>TV and other mindless activities</li>
<li>(tentatively) reading?</li>
</ul>
