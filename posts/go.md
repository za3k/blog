Today I hacked together a simple but servicable [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) game. It uses chinese scoring, and you have to manually mark dead stones at the end of the game. You can play [a demo](https://za3k.github.io/go/) here. Source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/go).

Right now you have to sit down with someone else to play. I plan to spend a day adding multiplayer to a few games, if I have time.
