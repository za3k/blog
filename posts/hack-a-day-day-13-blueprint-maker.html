<p>Hack-A-Day is a challenge to try and finish 30 projects in 30 days in November.</p>
<p>Today I tried to write a tool to make a floorplan. You can try it <a href="https://za3k.github.io/ha3k-13-blueprint/">here</a>. As usual the source code is <a href="https://github.com/za3k/ha3k-13-blueprint">on github</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://za3k.github.io/ha3k-13-blueprint/"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1191" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="301" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3.png" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3.png 635w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3-150x71.png 150w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3-250x119.png 250w" width="635"/></a></figure>
<p>This was an ambitious project for one day, and I didnâ€™t finish everything I wanted. My original goal was to support</p>
<ul>
<li>drawing and erasing rectangles (done)</li>
<li>adding, editing, deleting, and moving text labels (not done)</li>
<li>adding, deleting, and moving icons (mostly not done)</li>
<li>autosave (done)</li>
<li>undo support (done)</li>
<li>zoom and pan (not done)</li>
<li>sharing finished projects (stretch goal, not done)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I did do was pleasantly high-quality, and I made pretty good progress.</p>
