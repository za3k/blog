Can't Stop is a push-your-luck style dice game designed by Sid Sackson in 1980. I've found it to be fun on BoardGameArena.

I wrote my own version for hack-a-day. You can [play online](https://za3k.github.io/cant-stop/). The source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/cant-stop).

I'm pretty happy with this one. I didn't get to online play or even AI opponents, but you can play on your own or against friends in the room.
