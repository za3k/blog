It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Tank](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/tank/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/tank/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day17_tank)). It’s a relaxing fishtank toy. Enjoy.
