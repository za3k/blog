title: "Hack-a-Day, Day 17: Python Challenge"
---

Hack-a-Day is a challenge to complete one project a day in November from scratch.

Today's "hack" was a blitz of the [Python Challeng](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/). I didn't finish it -- I got through about 10 of the 33 total levels.

Since the goal is really to practice your python and have fun with riddles, no code shared on this one.

Peace out!
