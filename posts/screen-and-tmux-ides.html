<div class="entry-content">
<p>I don’t usually like IDEs. They’re hard to switch off of, they do too much. They don’t let me customize things, and I always have to use external tools anyway. I’d really rather do things with a bunch of small tools, the linux way. The problem is, if I close everything, I’ll have trouble getting started back up again. Saving state is one solution. Quick start-up is another. Basically, write a checklist for myself to make starting things up easy (open such-and-such files in the editor, start the server in debug mode, etc).</p>
<p>But we’re programmers, so obviously we’re not going to use a literal checklist. Instead, we’re going to write a little script to auto-start things in a new screen session:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/screen -c
# game_development.screen.conf
# Run stand-alone or with screen -c game_devel.screen.conf
screen -t "Vim" 2 bash -c "vim -p *.t"
bind "r" screen -t "Game" 2 bash run.sh</pre>
<p>Or if you prefer tmux:</p>
<pre># game_development.tmux.conf
# Run with tmux -f game_development.tmux.conf attach
new-session -s game_development
new-window -n "Vim" "bash -c 'vim -p *.t'"
bind r new-window -n "Game" "bash run.sh"</pre>
<p>Note the main features being used: a shebang line hack for screen, to let this file be self-contained and executable. Opening files in vim in place of a text editor. Binding keys for unit tests, running the program, restarting the server, etc. Now, a similar approach is to add new key bindings to the text editor, but I feel like text editors should edit text, and I like being able to document all the additions with help menus (which screen and tmux both support).</p>
<p>Note: <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">ratpoison</a> is similar to screen/tmux so you can do similar things in X.</p>
<p>One thing I’d love is if this kind of file was easy to dump from the current state, especially for things like positioning windows, etc. A little assistance is available, but not too much. Ratpoison and tmux let you dump sizing information. Nothing outputs keybindings or a list of running programs with their windows.</p>
<p>There <strong>is</strong> a program called <a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a> to let you write the same config in nested <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> of sessions, panes, and windows, which might appeal to some users.</p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="http://dtach.sourceforge.net/">dtach</a> if you don’t need panes and windows, and just want a detachable process.</p>
