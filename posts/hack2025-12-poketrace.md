Today's hack-a-day project was **Pokétrace**. Did you ever, as a little kid, trace stuff you liked? It's how we learn art! I made this as a way to relax for adult (and for kiddos, of course!). And to improve my art skills.

You can [trace pokemon in your browser](https://za3k.github.io/poketrace/). Let me know if you want any generations other than the first one, or show me any fan art you make! I'd love to see it.

This one should work on phones and tablets. Let me know if you run into any problems.

You can save your finished pokemon as an HTML file, and it should save progress (but only on your computer).

Open offer: if you trace all 150 pokemon, I'll make it into a coloring book version for everyone. And if you draw fan art of all 150 pokemon, I'll send you a poster of your art! (as long as you don't live somewhere with crazy shipping for me)

Enjoy!
