<p>Two friends and I wrote the intro to “Pint-Sized”, a 90s sitcom that never existed.</p>

<p>We used DALL-E and stable diffusion for images, <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a> to add captions, and Google’s <a href="https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/experiments/music-lm">AI Test Kitchen</a> for the backing music. Cheers were added with audacity. The video was edited together with ffmpeg.</p>
