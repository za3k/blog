title: 'Hack-a-Day, Day 12: Whiteboard to-do list'
---

Today I made a TODO list. It has whiteboard sections to write tasks in, an eraser, and a timer. You should be able to use it flat or on the wall, though it's a little bulky to use flat.

The blue is mostly spray paint, with some hand acrylic painting near the tape. The various bits on top are held in place with magnets, which I epoxied.

The cost to make this was $17. $5 for the whiteboard marker, $5 for the MDF board, and $7 for the timer. The eraser I made for free, I already had paints, whiteboard tape, epoxy, and magnets.

Originally I had planned to add a bunch of electronics (LEDs for which task is active), but I decided not to. I was having a rough time getting my microcontroller to work, or figuring out how to mount hardware. I don't think I would have been happy with the electronic version (even with enough time to do it well), and I am with this version.
