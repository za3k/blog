title: 'Whiteboard Calendar'
---

Using electrical tape, I split a whiteboard into sections. Voila, whiteboard calendar.

A teacher friend of mine already knew exactly how to do this--apparently it's common knowledge among teachers.

I did look if there were either large, disposable calendars (no) or existing whiteboard calendars (they're laminated posters that don't actually erase). A 3ft x 2ft (1m x 0.6m) whiteboard costs $30, and you can get electrical tape for $1.

The stickers look bad--I half-assed them. I need tons of big stickers or none at all. This was way too tentative. I do want some kind of decoration, though.
