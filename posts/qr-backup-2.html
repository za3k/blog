<div class="entry-content">
<p>qr-backup is a program to back up digital documents to physical paper. Restore is done with a webcam, video camera, or scanner. Someday smart phone cameras will work.</p>
<p>I’ve been making some progress on <a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup">qr-backup</a> v1.1. So far I’ve added:</p>
<ul><li><code>--restore</code>, which does a one-step restore for you, instead of needing a bash one-line restore process</li><li><code>--encrypt</code> provides password-based encryption</li><li>An automatic restore check that checks the generated PDF. This is mostly useful for me while maintaining qr-backup, but it also provides peace-of-mind to users.</li><li><code>--instructions</code> to give more fine-tuned control over printing instructions. There’s a “plain english” explanation of how qr-backup works that you can attach to the backup.</li><li><code>--note</code> for adding an arbitrary message to every sheet</li><li>Base-64 encoding is now per-QR code, each QR is self-contained.</li><li>Codes are labeled N01/50 instead of 01/50, to support more code types in the future.</li><li>Code cleanup of QR generation process.</li><li>Several bugfixes.</li></ul>
<p>v1.1 will be released when I make qr-backup feature complete:</p>
<ul><li>Erasure coding, so you only need 70% of the QRs to do a restore.</li><li>Improve webcam restore slightly.</li></ul>
<p>v1.2 will focus on adding a GUI and support for Windows, Mac, and Android. Switching off zbar is a requirement to allow multi-platform support, and will likely improve storage density.</p>
