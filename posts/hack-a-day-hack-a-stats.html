<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/stats/">Hack-A-Stats</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/stats/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day14_stats">source</a>). It displays web traffic statistics about Hack-A-Day.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/stats/"><img alt="" class="wp-image-897" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="530" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-12.png" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-12.png 593w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-12-300x268.png 300w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-12-150x134.png 150w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-12-168x150.png 168w" width="593"/></a></figure>
<p>The original point of the project was to show some nice graphs in d3, as an effort to teach myself d3. But halfway through I got unbearably bored by “show a bunch of stats” as a project, so no d3. Whoops! You win some you lose some.</p>
