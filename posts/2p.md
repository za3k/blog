title: 'Hack-a-Day, Day 20: 2p library'
---

Today I wrote a very small library for converting games to multiplayer. I was able to convert my Go game so you can play online with other players.

Go demo is [here](https://za3k.github.io/go/). 2p library source code is [available as a gist](https://gist.github.com/za3k/028bbd83e6b74f305db04b2a5fe7500e), or you can view the [go game source code](https://github.com/za3k/go).
