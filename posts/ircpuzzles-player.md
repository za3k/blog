I wrote a player for #ircpuzzles, a yearly puzzle hunt hosted on IRC. Many people who might like to try the puzzles don't know how to use IRC. So, now you can replay past years online.

I didn't have time to finish this one. It only has one year, and is missing a little polish. I'd call it about 80% done. It worked as a warmup for [hack-a-day](https://blog.za3k.com/tag/hack-a-day/), my yearly project to complete one project a day in November.

Demo is [here](https://za3k.github.io/ircpuzzles-solver/). Source is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/ircpuzzles-solver).
