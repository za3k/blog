I wrote a player for #ircpuzzles, a yearly puzzle hunt hosted on IRC. Many people who might like to try the puzzles don't know how to use IRC. So, now you can replay past years online.

I didn't have time to finish this one. It only has one year, and is missing a little polish. I'd call it about 80% done. It worked as a warmup.
