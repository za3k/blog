title: 'Hack-A-Day, Day 26: No Room for Error'
---
I made a coding challenge, vaguely tied up as a game. Your goal is to complete simple coding challenges, with a major twist--you only get one try. You can only hit RUN once. (Well, actually you can hit RUN more than once. But it gets marked as failed.)

[![caption: the game is called "No Room For Error"](no-room-for-error.png)](https://za3k.github.io/no-room-for-error)

It put together about 10 challenges, together with some story narration.

**IF THIS MESSAGE MESSAGE IS UP, THE GAME IS PROBABLY BUGGY:** The game problems are currently untested. There may very well be some bugs. If you play, please send me correct answers so I can include them, as well as any bugs you find.

You can [play online](https://za3k.github.io/no-room-for-error). The code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/no-room-for-error)
