Hack-A-Day is a challenge to try and finish 30 projects in 30 days in November.

Today I tried to write a tool to make a floorplan. You can try it [here](https://za3k.github.io/ha3k-13-blueprint/). As usual the source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/ha3k-13-blueprint).

This was an ambitious project for one day, and I didnâ€™t finish everything I wanted. My original goal was to support

-   drawing and erasing rectangles (done)
-   adding, editing, deleting, and moving text labels (not done)
-   adding, deleting, and moving icons (mostly not done)
-   autosave (done)
-   undo support (done)
-   zoom and pan (not done)
-   sharing finished projects (stretch goal, not done)

What I did do was pleasantly high-quality, and I made pretty good progress.
