[Hack-a-Day](https://za3k.com/hackaday) is my self-imposed challenge to do one project a day, for all of November.

Today I made **Kim's Game**. It's a recreation of (or a riff on) a classic spy-training memory game from the 1901 book *Kim*.

You can play [online here](https://za3k.github.io/kims-game/). The source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/kims-game).
