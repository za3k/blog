<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/icecube/">Hack-An-Icecube</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/icecube/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day06_icecube">source</a>). It’s a failed attempt to make a game in Unity3D, the game engine/framework.</p>
<p>This is my first failure, which I think is good! I was getting bored only attempting things I could definitely succeed at in one day. That said, running out of time is fun. Wrestling the IDE isn’t. This was mostly wrestling the IDE, setting configs, and installing software.</p>
<p>I won’t continue this tomorrow, I’d rather do a new project each day (It’s called Hack-A-<strong>DAY</strong>)! But I might do another Unity3D project before the month is out.</p>

<p>The ice cubes load and fall, and that’s it. No controls, no game. I ran out of time.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to recreate <a href="https://juzek.itch.io/one-hour-jam-cannon">One Hour Jam Cannon</a> by juzek exactly. I ran out of time, but I made some progress getting Unity to work.</p>
