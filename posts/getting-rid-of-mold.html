<div class="entry-content">
<p>Take everything in this article with a cup of salt, I’m not even close to an expert.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been itchy, so I’m treating a couple areas of my house for mold and mildew–the walls of my basement, and a new couch I got. I’ve been researching mold treatments. Some of them are clearly absolute nonsense<em>.</em></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>never trust any cleaning procedure that involves mixing baking soda and vinegar</em></p>
<cite>– za3k’s 42nd law</cite></blockquote>
<p>The sensical mold-killing strategies I’ve found boil down to “Remove moisture, so the mold doesn’t come back”, plus one of the following. <strong>I do not know which of these are effective.</strong> I also can’t guarantee the specific procedures I tried work.</p>
<p><strong>Sunlight / UV lamp (UV light)</strong>: I didn’t get good data about whether this works, but it makes some sense. The recommendation I got was 1-3 hours. <br/><em>My attempt:</em> None. I’d need a UV lamp, since I can’t easily get sunlight where I’m cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Bleach (oxidizer)</strong>: Generally held to be pretty effective. Not good for fabrics. <br/><em>My attempt: </em>I tried it on my basement (dilute to about 0.15%, then pour or spray, scrub afterwards). <br/><em>My attempt: </em>I also added a little to laundry while I washed the couch cushions and my sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Vinegar (acid)</strong>: I would suspect vinegar is not very effective (several people claim mold can tolerate low pH better than high pH, and <a href="https://sail-delmarva.blogspot.com/">Drew Frye</a> who does a lot of actual testing on boats claims that vinegar acts as food for the mold, helping it come back). OTOH I have anecdotal evidence that it works.<br/><em>My attempt</em>: None.</p>
<p><strong>Concrobium (a base)</strong>: This is a mix of trisodium phosphate (pH 12), sodium carbonate or “washing soda” (pH 11) and sodium bicarbonate or “baking soda” (pH 9). I suspect it works really well, because there’s a good explanation as to why it should. Store-bought concrobium is also quite expensive, so I’d make your own. I suspect you don’t need all three ingredients, because I think they’re doing the same thing.<br/><em>My attempt</em>: I sprayed spray-can concrobium on my couch, which covered maybe 1/6 of the couch with a $13 can. Plan to make some <a href="https://sail-delmarva.blogspot.com/2016/12/mildew-treatment-for-pennies.html">homemade</a> to finish the job.<br/>Edit: Muurkha advises that you can make sodium carbonate by boiling sodium bicarbonate for about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Clove oil (anti-microbial)</strong>: Most people who recommend it have a bit of an anti-science attitude, which means they tend to give… silly specific advice. But there’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763181/">published</a> research that it works, I just don’t know the best way to apply it, how long it works, or how it works. It seems possible that clove oil is a bit more species-specific than the other methods.<br/><em>My attempt</em>: None.</p>
<p>Mechanisms, as I understand them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunlight and bleach should destroy mold and mold spores, by denaturing things.</li>
<li>Vinegar and concrobium should prevent mold growth by making an environment mold can’t grow in (wrong pH)</li>
<li>I have no idea how clove oil might work, but both applying the oil and vapor work.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think high or low temperatures will work to kill molds generally, from my research.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this research is that I <em>don’t</em> have a large, visible mold patch. I’m just itchy. So don’t expect a report back about whether this stuff worked, honestly.</p>
