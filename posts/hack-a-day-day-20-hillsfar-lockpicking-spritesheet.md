For today’s hack-a-day, I meant to clone the [Hillsfar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsfar) lockpicking minigame. Instead, I spent all day just extracting the sprites. But I had a nice chill time, so it was great.

Edit: See the [updated post](https://blog.za3k.com/hillsfar-lockpicking-20-complete/) for the finished game.

Here’s the original minigame:

Here’s my spritesheet:

I made it by splitting up screenshots:
