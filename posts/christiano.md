title: The Christiano Bootstrap
---

One of my interests is "bootstrap" methods. That is, a minimal set of habits or processes, that when adopted end up making you cool down the line. For example, "study the habits of successful people" might be a good habit. If you do that, you might find yourself adopting other good habits.

As such, I often ask people what habits lead to all their other habits, and about habits in general.

The following bootstrap procedure is courtesy to P Christiano:

1. At the end of the day, review what happened. What went well? What could have gone better?
2. For everything that could have gone better, write down something you will do to make sure it goes better in the future.
3. No repeats. That is, if you write down "Talk to Mary before scheduling lunch", and you find yourself not talking to her and would write that down a second time -- don't. Come up with a new intervention the second time.

Today's challenge was to try it out, but I set a timer to do it once an hour, rather than once a day, for the sake of compressing it down.

It went pretty good, actually.

One of my early failures was that I was vaguely thinking of things I could do better, without having a list or turning them into action items. It's important to go meta with these processes to fix bugs like that. In fact, P points out you don't really need rule 3 for this reason.

The note-taking app from yesterday was useful again today.

Nothing big to report, just another experiment.
