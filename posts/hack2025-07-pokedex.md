Today's hack-a-day project was the **Pokédex** -- the fictional companion that tells you about pokemon in the game. My main goal was just to get the info into a [reasonable database format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/za3k/pokedex-art.json/refs/heads/master/data/pokedex.json), but along with way I built a [little viewer](https://za3k.github.io/pokedex-art.json/) too.

The plan is to make some kind of art game where you do pokemon fanart, a coloring book, or even a tracing game in the coming days. And now I'm ready, with art of each pokemon on hand.
