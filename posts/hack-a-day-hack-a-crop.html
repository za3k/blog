<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/crop/">Hack-A-Crop</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/crop/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day18_crop">source</a>). It crops an image to a fixed size.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/crop/"><img alt="" class="wp-image-911" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="483" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-16.png" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-16.png 926w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-16-300x156.png 300w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-16-768x401.png 768w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-16-150x78.png 150w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-16-250x130.png 250w" width="926"/></a></figure>
<p>I got help from several people on the CSS, thanks to instantly sharing my work via <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> from my laptop. Thanks people! Thanks ngrok!</p>
<p>Today’s project was in anticipation of showing off what I did at the end of the month. I want a small thumbnail for each project.</p>
