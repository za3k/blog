<li>a rough cut, blow, or stroke. (the work was accomplished one hack at a time)</li>

<p>Hack-A-Day is challenge to make complete one new project, from scratch, every day in November 2023.</p>
<p>Last year (2022), I set myself the challenge to make a software project every day, and met it. I had a ton of fun, and make a lot of <a href="https://za3k.com/hackaday">cool video games and projects</a> I can show off. This year I’m inviting the rest of the world to join me!</p>
<p>I’m a programmer, so I’m doing a new computer programming project every day. But you can do any kind of project, whatever you pick is great.</p>
