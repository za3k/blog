It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Wednesday’s project was [Hack-A-Link 2](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day02_link)). It’s an open link directory.

This was very much a “phone it in” project. I do think it could have been better if I had added descriptions, too.
