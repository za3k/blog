title: 'Hack-a-Day, Day 05: Milling an Aluminium Soma Cube (FAILED)'
---

As on [day 02](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-02-acrylic-soma-cube-failed/), I tried to make a soma cube, this time milling it out of aluminium on a milling machine.

I picked up some aluminium from a local supplier, and headed to [Hive13](https://hive13.org/), the local hackerspace, to use their milling machine.

After about 7 hours, despite hard work, I had almost finished cutting the blanks, and that was it. Milling is no joke, especially for a beginner!

And had to call it a night, both because I was tired and because the weekly meeting was starting. I was feeling pretty rough after this one -- three, nearly four failed projects in a row is not a great start to a hackathon.
