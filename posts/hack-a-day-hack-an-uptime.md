It’s no longer november, but I’m still doing a project a day. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-An-Uptime](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/uptime/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/uptime/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day34_uptime)). It’s a simple experiment where you press a button every day.

This was a very simple project. I’m curious what will happen with it.
