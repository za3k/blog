It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Hell](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/hell/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/hell/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day22_hell)). It’s a bullet hell game combined with a music visualizer.

I’m happy with this one, although it took way too long given yesterday’s project! I keep thinking I’ll be able to modify or re-use things quickly, and it’s not true.

P.S. Taking the next day or two off for thanksgiving
