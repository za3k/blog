title: Reverse Vibe Coding
---
Yikes, been having some back pain, and the past few days it's been tougher to work. I've started four projects in four days, without too much to show for it.

- Day 01 project is waiting on computation to run; overall I'm happy with it but will post when I get the results.
- Day 02 project I barely started and won't finish, most likely. It takes a photo of a Go board and tries to output the game. I'd learn some image processing doing it, but I'm sure there's plenty of existing and better tools to do the same thing.
- Day 03 project was a bit ambitious. Will post it if I finish (and hopefully I will, it's cool!)

Today's hack-a-day project was **Reverse Vibe Coding**. I sometimes use LLMs such as Claude for "vibe coding", mostly on throwaway type projects. It didn't seem fair for that to go only one way, so today I offered to vibe code for Claude -- it picks what I should make, and I code it up for Claude.

The result is the [Conversation Flow Visualizer](https://za3k.github.io/hack-reversevibe1/). This graphs when new topics come up in conversation, and what they are.

Frankly I think it's dumb and useless, but Claude is the boss, so there ya go! Can't pick who you work fo... okay, I guess I could this time.

In any case, it was pretty relaxing to be a junior dev and just do as I'm told for a bit, honestly. Easy win.

I honestly think this would be a good way to learn a new programming language or a new library.

Peace out!
