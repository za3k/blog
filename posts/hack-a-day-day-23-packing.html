<p>I’m moving, so I have to pack. I thought I’d make it fun with two projects.</p>
<p>First, I entered everything I was packing into a text file, <strong>stuff.md</strong>. That way, I can find stuff later. I have two friends who have done something like this, so I’m curious how it will go for me. Here is a sample:</p>

<p>Second, I took a time lapse video of packing. I wish I had time-lapsed moving in at my current place, but I just wasn’t set up for it. Sadly, my camera battery died after 90 minutes, so I only have a very short video. Next time I’ll plug in a power cable. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEYZWD2gQsQ">short example video</a>.</p>
<p>Both are much too personal for me to post on the web in full.</p>
