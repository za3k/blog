<!-- blogpost -->
<div class="entry-content">
<p>I’m experimenting with using Jekyll in place of wordpress. If you want you can check out [dead link] which containly my weekly review process.</p>
<p>If and when I do migrate, all the posts here will be magically migrated and the URLs will stay the same so links don’t break.</p>
<p>Edit: I discontinued this experiment. It’s too hard to migrate the old stuff and keep it looking good, and I’d rather keep everything in one system.</p>
