Today's hack-a-day project was the **German Language Reader**. It shows you the text of "German Legends" by the Brothers Grimm. Yes, the same brothers known for "Grimm's Fairy Tales" and perhaps less-so, the first dictionary.

If you highlight a word, you get the definition in english.

You can [try it online](https://za3k.github.io/hack-german/). As usual, source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/hack-german).

I had hoped to have a German mode, but the German wiktionary API [has been down](https://en.wiktionary.org/api/rest_v1/page/definition/gewesen) for a week!

If you're technically inclined, it's not too bad to substitute in your own book. You'll need it in TXT format (to extract the words), and HTML format (to display).

I'm happy with this project, although I am posting it on the 10th, quite a bit late.

I had some minor help from Claude.

Enjoy!
