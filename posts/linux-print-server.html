<div class="entry-content">
<p>So have you ever used a web printer and it was great?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Yeah, me neither. <span id="more-293"></span>It’s probably possible on windows, but try to add more than one OS to the network and it’s horrible. And actually printing is a major pain in Linux anyway. Theoretically ‘lp’ and the like have no problem with remote printers, but I wanted something I understood. So today I’m going to post my setup I use instead.</p>
<p>I have a computer physically connected to the printer. Let’s call it ‘printserver’. On that server there is a folder, /printme, which is constantly monitored by inode. Any file added to that directory is printed.</p>
<p>Suppose I downloaded cutecats.pdf and I want to print it. Then I run:</p>
<pre lang="bash">scp cutecats.pdf printserver:/printme
</pre>
<p>And voila, the cute cats get printed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here’s the setup for the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the printer to work. This is the hard step.</li>
<li>Make a directory /printme. Add any missing users, add a new group called ‘print’ and add everyone who needs to print to that, etc.</li>
<li>Set up /printme to be a tmpfs with the sticky bit set. (So we don’t fill up the hard drive)
<pre lang="sh">/etc/fstab
tmpfs           /printme        tmpfs   rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec,uid=nobody,gid=print,mode=1770,size=1G  0       0</pre>
</li>
<li>Install incron and add this to the incrontab (of user ‘print’ or ‘sudo’):
<pre lang="bash"># incrontab -l
/printme IN_CLOSE_WRITE,IN_MOVED_TO lp $@/$#</pre>
<p>Note that this will preserve files after they’re printed, because my server is low-volume enough I don’t need to care.</p></li>
</ol>
