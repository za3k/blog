<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project was <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/experiment/">Hack-An-Experiment</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/experiment/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day25_experiment">source</a>). It’s designed to present the basics of experimental algorithmics, while also getting me acquainted with d3.</p>

<p>I have to say, I keep seeing d3 sold as a “graphing” library. And it’s definitely not. Maybe you could write one on top of it.</p>
