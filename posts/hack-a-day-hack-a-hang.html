<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/hang/">Hack-A-Hang</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/hang/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day19_hang">source</a>). It’s a place to hang out. It has text chat, video, and audio.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Hack-A-Hang is NOT WORKING.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately while everything works great on my machine, there’s a bad problem in production, and I ran out of time on this one. I’ll try to get it fixed before the end of the month if it’s easy.</p>

<p>Hoo boy, this was one of the technically hardest ones so far. WebRTC is no joke. And not hard in a way where you have to think, hard in a way where the debugging tools are terrible. (Drag and drop was another tough one)</p>
