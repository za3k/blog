Today I wrote a little game where you make food in a kitchen.

You can [play here](https://za3k.github.io/pixel-kitchen/). Source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/pixel-kitchen).

This was so-so. I didn't have a ton of fun making it, and it's not that fun to play either. I spent way too much time with things like trying to get sprites to load, and not as much on making the game fun. I think it could be much better with another day or two of work (as usual for hack-a-day).
