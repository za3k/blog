Today I made a minecraft mod, using Fabric. Modding sure has changed a lot since I last tried it in Forge, maybe ten years ago! Java's changed a little too, even.

My mod adds a dirt slab, that's it. I didn't really have time to get past the basics, but I think the occasional hack that's just a learning experience is okay.

[Code](https://github.com/za3k/dirt-slab-fabric-mod) and [mod download](https://github.com/za3k/dirt-slab-fabric-mod/releases/tag/v1.0.0) are both on github this time.
