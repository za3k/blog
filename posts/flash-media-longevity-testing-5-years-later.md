title: "Flash media longevity testing -- 5 years later"
---
-   [Year 0](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/e3nb2r/longterm_reliability_testing/) – I filled 10 32-GB Kingston flash drives with random data.
-   [Year 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/lwgsdr/research_flash_media_longevity_testing_1_year/) – Tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drive 1 with the same data.
-   [Year 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/tb26cy/flash_media_longevity_testing_2_years_later/) – Tested drive 2, zero bit rot. Re-tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drives 1-2 with the same data.
-   [Year 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/102razr/flash_media_longevity_testing_3_years_later/) – Tested drive 3, zero bit rot. Re-tested drives 1-2, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drives 1-3 with the same data.
-   [Year 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18w3bxw/flash_media_longevity_testing_4_years_later/) – Tested drive 4, zero bit rot. Re-tested drives 1-3, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drives 1-4 with the same data.
-   **Year 5** - Re-tested drives 1-3, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drives 1-3 with the same data.

Will report back in **1 more year** when I test drive 5.

The full test plan is available [in the year 4 blog post](https://blog.za3k.com/flash-media-longevity-testing-4-years-later/)
