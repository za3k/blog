What happened in 2020? Well,

-   (General news) COVID-19 of course, and Trump left office
-   I stayed inside. I‚Äôve been getting groceries delivered, even‚ÄìI‚Äôve been somewhere other than my house maybe twice since COVID-19 lockdown started.
-   I started watching wayyy more videos, especially video game streams.
-   I looked into buying land in Colorado and living in an RV
-   I [transcribed](https://blog.za3k.com/time-log-transcribed/) my log books, and started coverting them all to a standard, computer-parsable format (mostly done, one left).
-   I deleted [bs](https://blog.za3k.com/postmortem-bs-store/).
-   I figured out [twitch streaming](https://blog.za3k.com/streaming-linux-twitch-using-ffmpeg-and-alsa/), both with a standalone capture card and on linux.
-   I got hardware random number generators to work.
-   I designed v1 and v2 of a protocol to allow a set of computers to store a large amount of content. It‚Äôs designed to back up things like the Internet Archive. I‚Äôm calling the project ‚Äúvalhalla‚Äù, after ArchiveTeams‚Äôs project [valhalla](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Valhalla) and IA.BAK.
-   I learned to use an oscilloscope, and bit-banged SPI and I2C for a while, trying to get a 9-axis sensor to work unsuccessfully.
-   I learned how to make a pretty good pizza
-   I played a bunch of video games
-   I [worked](https://github.com/za3k/busy_beaver) on the Lazy Beaver [problem](https://oeis.org/A337805), and tied the state of the art.
-   I made a master TODO list, and finished every single TODO I had that took an hour or less.
-   I figured out how to make VMs in Linux and run them all the time
-   I got a tablet, and learned GIMP and InkScape well enough to draw some stuff.
-   I wrote a custom client for omegle
-   I did a yearly backup
-   I did various research. I learned about algorithms, data structures, RALA, and quantum physics.
-   I wrote up my [cookbook](https://blog.za3k.com/cookbook/) and released it.
-   I wrote some blog posts üôÇ
-   Four of my friends moved to Ohio, two from nearby me. I only know one person in the state I‚Äôm in well at this point.
-   A friend of mine got out of jail and got to go home.
