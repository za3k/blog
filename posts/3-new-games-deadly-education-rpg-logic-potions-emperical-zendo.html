<ul><li><a href="https://za3k.com/archive/emperical_zendo.md">Emperical Zendo</a>, a semi-competitive game for 3-8 players based on the icehouse game Zendo. Vaguely based on rants by Bayesians.</li><li><a href="https://za3k.com/archive/logic_potions.md">Logic Potions</a>, a competitive game about deductive logic and making new rules for 2-4 players.
