<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/farm/">Hack-A-Farm</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/farm/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day27_farm">source</a>). It’s a simple tile-based RPG. You can walk around as a chicken, admire your house, and plant and harvest two types of crops. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/farm/"><img alt="" class="wp-image-948" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="737" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-25.png" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-25.png 691w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-25-281x300.png 281w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-25-141x150.png 141w" width="691"/></a></figure>
<p>My main goal with this project was to work with spritesheets or animation before, which I had never done. Showing off the individual tiles is deliberate. Also, the game should respond well to smaller and larger screens, I hope.</p>
<p>I had a good time with this one, and I’m happy with how much I got done in a day. I originally planned to do more fluid walking (it was called Hack-A-Walk), but it was more fun to add crops instead.</p>
<p>I re-used some of the logic from Hack-A-Minigame and Hack-A-Snake. I’ve been finding d3 to be mildly useful, if a little annoying.</p>
