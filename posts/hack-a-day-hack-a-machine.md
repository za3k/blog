It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Machine](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/machine/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/machine/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day10_machine)). It’s a whimsical VM you can play around with.

I liked this one, but it really didn’t fit into a day too well.

Features include:

-   Edit, save, and share programs!
-   Visual debugger with step, run, pause, and stop!
-   One example program!
-   Weird arithmetic!
-   Negative-364 based addressing!
-   “Touchscreen” display!
-   “Ticker tape” input and output!
-   21 never before seen instructions!
-   Optional registration!

Sadly not in the “one day” category are

-   good compiler errors
-   line numbering
-   line highlighting when stepping through code
-   syntax highlighting
-   the entire machine 100% working (I tested a little!)
-   fixing all the bugs (there’s a particularly nasty one where you have to save before you run)
