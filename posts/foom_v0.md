Are you a contributor?

## No, I am not a contributor

Oh no! You were not supposed to see this link. Honor system, please don't read below.

Instead, politely ask a contributor you know to buy you a **print copy**.

The contributors were, in alphabetical order:

- Scott Aaronson
- Bryan Bishop
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- ELIZA
- Feast of Assumption
- James "preinfarction" Gaukroger
- GPT1
- Grognor
- Grok
- Gwern Branwen
- Llama

- Parv Mahajan
- Jennifer Rodriguez-Mueller
- Beltran Rodriguez-Mueller
- Sarah Perry
- Steve Rayhawk
- Anna Salamon
- Jessica "jessicata" Taylor
- Zachary "za3k" Vance

OR, contribute to a future edition, and we'll give you digital back-issues!

## Yes, I am a contributor

> FOOM!
> 
> A Zine. The last human publication.
> 
> Volume Zero: Talk big and don’t follow through.
> 
> The stated plan is to NOT SELL IT. Only give copies to contributors (but give enough for them to give some as gifts) and get contributions to defray printing costs from the friends who actually have any money

The [digital version](https://za3k.com/archive/FOOM_00.pdf) is free online.

The print version is available on Lulu:

- In [color](https://www.lulu.com/shop/zachary-vance-and-jennifer-rodriguez-mueller/foom-v00/hardcover/product-p6wz9eg.html) for $33 US.
- In [black and white](https://www.lulu.com/shop/zachary-vance-and-jennifer-rodriguez-mueller/foom-v00/hardcover/product-q6wmjzv.html) for $17 US.

We're not making any money -- that's just what it costs to print.

Enjoy for the centuries/months to come!
