<p>Sep, Oct, Nov 2014: Vietnam.</p>
<p>A year ago, I left my job at Streak and moved to Vietnam. I felt like I needed change. Vietnam ended up being wonderful; I was really glad I travelled with my friends <a href="http://www.jollybit.com/">Richard</a> and <a href="http://thedragonseyelashes.tumblr.com/">Kathy</a>, which ended up making the experience a hundred times better than it would have been otherwise. The basic environment was: everything is cheap, I newly have endless free time, I was automatically prompted by my friends in the evenings and sometimes during the day to go on small novel adventures involving physical activity, and I had little internet access. This is probably my perfect environment, and I was functioning very well (the vietnamese diet also has small, well-balanced meals which might have helped). For some reason, I was also able to intensely single-task. [I’d like to write more about what Vietnam is like, but this article is quite long enough as it is]</p>
<p>While I was in Vietnam, I made a to-do list. The to-do list had all the burning projects I actually wanted to do. I’ve ended up accomplishing most of them, at a rate of one every week or two, and it’s a decent summary of what I’ve been doing since. Two things made the to-do list a success. First, it had BIG tasks. These are projects like my recent “set up an IRC server” or “start a publishing company”. Because of that, I don’t get bogged down in minutae, and the tasks are always motivating. I find I function better when I try to carefully plan around having any logistics. The second reason, which I realized today, is that I was very careful to only include tasks I was planning to do (subtly different than tasks I wanted to do). The list was descriptive, not normative, although it certainly included some things like doing taxes I wasn’t wild about.</p>
<p>Looking at my journal and it really only starts up again in March, so I’m going to organize this post in terms of the to-do list. There are a couple items that don’t fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started dating my wonderful pet, <a href="http://sick-ghost.tumblr.com/">Lealend</a>, while I was in Vietnam. I went to visit them for a month in Puerto Rico where they live. This is very very important to me (the most important thing that happened in the last year), but I don’t usually write about things that personal on my blog so I’m not doing to say much. I’ve been emotionally maturing a lot by being with them.</li>
<li>Conventions. I went to <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON</a>, which was probably the best single week this year so far. I’m definitely going again next year. I attended a <a href="https://intelligence.org/mirix/">mirix</a> [paper] in the South Bay, which ended up being stressful for transportation-related reasons but really good while I was there. I’m planning on going to <a href="http://burningman.org/">Burning Man</a> this year as well.</li>
<li>I started contracting, that’s how I’ve been alive for a year. I’ve been doing some work for <a href="http://priceyak.com/">Zinc</a> and <a href="http://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a> on a <a href="https://github.com/WuTheFWasThat/vimflowy">workflowy clone</a>, mostly. I work two hours a day average.</li>
<li>I’ve been developing a <a href="http://za3k.com/colony.md">minecraft modpack</a> [I’ll write more about this when it’s stable], and recently taken an interest in livestreaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now on to the to-do list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid2" style="color: #000000;">Project: Printserver<br/>
Success: Success but obsolete<br/>
Description: I set up a printserver. It’s a little raspberry pi that talks to my printer, because getting printers set up is a pain and I don’t want to do it all the time. It went great, it saved me a ton of hassle to have it automatically print out my daily agenda every morning, and to just be able to transfer documents over with ‘scp’.<br/>
Future plans: Unfortunately, my printer died and we only recently got a new one. I need to set it up with the new server. I could also make printing completely automatic when new files show up with scp (right now it’s manual so I can switch out paper, but my roommates would be happier with scp I think).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid2" style="color: #000000;">Project: Set up my phone so dropping/losing it isn’t horrible<br/>
Success: Partial success<br/>
Description: I wanted to root and then <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/backup-android-on-plugin/" title="Backup android on plugin">automatically backup</a> my phone. I did figure out how to do as much backing up as I can, and it is automatic. Unfortunately it turns out most of the filesystem (including SMS) just isn’t available over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol">Media Transfer Protocol</a> which android uses to display files, so I had to special case the things I desperately needed backed up. I’d prefer the state of the world let me back up everything on the phone, but that’s as much work as I’m willing to do.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid2" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid3" style="color: #000000;">Project: Get digital copies of all books I own<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: I got digital copies of all books I own via a combination of pirating, buying copies, and getting the books scanned by a service. I did <em>not</em> get rid of the physical books.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid3" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid4" style="color: #000000;">Project: Switch to private email<br/>
Success: Not done<br/>
Description: I get a little nervous entrusting Google (or any third party) with the ability to read, lose, or add restrictions on what I can do with my email. I want to set up my own email address (<a href="mailto:za3k@za3k.com">za3k@za3k.com</a>) and have it be my main point of contact. My email does work, but I can’t send outgoing email, and I haven’t switched everything over to it for that reason.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid4" style="color: #000000;">Project: Download ArXiV<br/>
Success: Done<br/>
Description: As an <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/tag/backup/">archive nut</a>, I worry that the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">ArXiV</a> collection, one of the nicer collections of scientific papers I access regularly, might someday go down or get censored. I downloaded a copy and stashed it away somewhere. Unfortunately ArXiV’s licenses they get papers under doesn’t permit redistribution, so I can’t publicly host it. (This was really cool but I had to decide whether I was going to publicly mention, since it’s a legal gray area)<br/>
Future plans: Someone (not me) should host a torrent. Contact me and I can get you a copy.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid7" style="color: #000000;">Project: Pack and unpack storage bins (trip to vietnam)<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: Okay I know this sounds stupid, but I spent about a month packing up to go to Vietnam, and all my physical stuff has stayed organized ever since. That’s a really big change for me.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid9" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Host an IRC server<br/>
Success: <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/irc/" title="IRC">Success</a></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid9" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid10" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Make hibernate work on my laptop<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: This involved switching partitioning around since btrfs doesn’t support swap files. If I recall, my setup is now a swap partition and a root btrfs partition, inside LVM, inside LUKS.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid10" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid11" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Extract bitcoins<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: Extract bitcoins from all my computers and centralize them in one place</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid11" style="color: #000000;">Project: iPhone<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: Back up all my personal data from my iPhone, clear the contents, and sell it.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid11" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid13" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: N-grams<br/>
Success: Obsolete<br/>
Description: The <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html">Google N-grams dataset</a> from their book scanning project is freely available, but in a terrible format (split across set-size file chunks, but in random rather than sorted order). My plan was to convert the formatting and offer it as a torrent / s3 bucket. Google has corrected the problem in a revised version of the dataset.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid13" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid14" style="color: #000000;">Project: NNTP over tor<br/>
Success: Didn’t do<br/>
Description: I run a private newsserver, and I wanted to let people access the newsserver (and anything else on that physical server) over tor. I decided the newsserver was too dead to bother with, and I didn’t feel enthusiastic about setting up tor, so I dropped the project.<br/>
Future plans: I don’t care about the original project, but if there’s a compelling stimulus, I want to set up tor for my server to learn how and leave flexibility.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid14" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid15" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Textmode backup<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: ‘textmode’ is the name of a virtual machine on my OS X machine. The project was to back up contents of the machine once, and then delete the virtual machine</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid15" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid16" style="color: #000000;">Project: Post pdfmailer website<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: I wanted people to be able to get a physical copy of a pdf document they had mailed to them. I think this project was an especial success, because I’d been failing at an over-engineered version of this off and on for a year. I decided to have the website email me instead of trying to do everything automatically, and ended up getting the books to be a factor of 10 cheaper or so by going with a publisher with no API.<br/>
Future plans: I’d like to popularize the website more. I think there are also some small technical improvements to be made. I’m not going to automate things unless it starts using up a lot of my time to process requests myself.</div>
</li>
<li>[Censored project involving an arbitrage opportunity I haven’t cornered]</li>
<li>Project: Back up email<br/>
Success: <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/archiving-gmail/" title="Archiving gmail">Success</a></li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid18" style="color: #000000;">Project: Flatten backups<br/>
Success: Good enough<br/>
Description: Oh just go read the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1360/">XKCD</a>. Now imagine you’ve been archiving computers onto other computers for 15 years, and buy cheap laptops.</div>
</li>
<li>Project: QR codes for ebooks<br/>
Success: <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/the-double-lives-of-books/" title="The Double Lives of Books">Success</a></li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid18" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid20" style="color: #000000;">Project: Business cards<br/>
Success: Not done<br/>
Description: Make some personal business cards</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid20" style="color: #000000;">Project: QR Punchcodes<br/>
Success: Didn’t do<br/>
Description: So you know how QR codes can contain any data? That means you could show them to a camera and the camera could run any code. Like, code to wait for another couple of QR codes, or to print out some more QR codes…</div>
</li>

<div id="magicdomid20" style="color: #000000;">[Censored project involving an arbitrage opportunity I haven’t cornered]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid20" style="color: #000000;">[Censored project involving a mildly illegal thing]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid25" style="color: #000000;">Project: Make a desk out of cardboard<br/>
Success: Ongoing<br/>
Description: I want to make a desk out of cardboard, because it sounds fun. I’m proud of doing the design right here. I’ve finished mocking it out of cardstock, and actually noticed a lot of flaws and fixed the design instead of hoping them away. Now I mostly have to get the cardboard and make it, should be fun.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid25" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid27" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Make a whiteboard partition<br/>
Success: <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/whiteboard-partition/" title="Whiteboard Partition">Success</a></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid27" style="color: #000000;">Project: Write about paper backups<br/>
Success: <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/paper-archival/" title="Paper archival">Success</a></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid27" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid28" style="color: #000000;">Project: Sort physical scans<br/>
Success: Success<br/>
Description: As part of packing up all my possessions to go to Vietnam, I scanned every physical document I own (and mostly threw them out). Twenty years of stuff is a lot of stuff, but I eventually sorted it all out. I’ve been increasingly finding that a flat folder structure ends up working out best for me in the long term, so that’s what I used.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid28" style="color: #000000;"></div>
<div id="magicdomid29" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Two-location backup<br/>
Success: Not done<br/>
Description: My backup server uses RAID-1, but I’d like to have a second copy on an external hard drive somewhere.  Also, I have a bunch of external hard drives which are currently not backed up anywhere (mostly with stuff like movies) which I’d like to have some kind of redundancy</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid29" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Treemap finances<br/>
Success: Not done<br/>
Description: I’ve made my <a href="http://za3k.com/money.html">finances public</a>, but my analysis tools aren’t great. I’d like to update some old work I’ve done and add a web interface to see where I spent money during a particular time span, using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemap</a> display.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid29" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Archive Github (aka download all the code in the world)<br/>
Success: Not done, on hold<br/>
Description: I’m kind of burnt out on archiving tasks lately, so this doesn’t sound fun to me. I decided to work with <a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">archive team</a> on this one. It’ll get done if it sounds low-stress and no one else seems to be doing it, but it’s less likely than the older archiving projects, despite being important for the world.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid29" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Encrypt backup<br/>
Success: Not done<br/>
Description: I’d like a way to back up my data to untrusted media, like tarsnap does, especially a way that avoids leaking file metadata (like access times and file lengths). Failing that, I should at least encrypt the drive backups are to so I can turn off that computer if needed.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div id="magicdomid29" style="color: #000000;"><span class="author-a-06xxz122z8hz78z2rz80zz81zz78z7aa">Project: Gwernify<br/>
Success: Not done<br/>
Description: Gwern writes about how to <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Archiving%20URLs">protect links</a> against link rot. He does this for all links on his website. I ambitiously plan to automatically save a copy of every site I visit (not just the actual URL I visit ideally, but the whole page).</span></div>
