<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Wednesday’s project was <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link/">Hack-A-Link 2</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day02_link">source</a>). It’s an open link directory.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link/"><img alt="" class="wp-image-932" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="201" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" src="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-20.png" srcset="https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-20.png 425w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-20-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-20-150x71.png 150w, https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot-20-250x118.png 250w" width="425"/></a></figure>
<p>This was very much a “phone it in” project. I do think it could have been better if I had added descriptions, too.</p>
