See [https://blog.ircpuzzles.org/2023/04/2023-april-fools-live/](https://blog.ircpuzzles.org/2023/04/2023-april-fools-live/) for how to play.

Every year, the libera IRC network has a puzzle contest starting on 04-01. (It’s not an april fools joke). It’s fun but quite difficult.

This year I wrote about a third of the puzzles. Give them a try, either alone or as a team! It will be open indefinitely, but social activity will die off in a week or two.

As of writing, no one has won (finished all the puzzles) just yet.
