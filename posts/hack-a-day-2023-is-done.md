Hack-A-Day 2023 is complete. I did 20 projects in 30 days. Pretty good considering I got a new job and moved!

The overview of the month is [here](https://za3k.com/hackaday) and highly recommended.

I plan to do a little more followup this year than last. Today’s last-minute fixes:

-   [Perquackey](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-01-perquackey/) (01) works on phones, tablets, and with the mouse. There’s an easter egg that displays any words you missed at the end.
-   [Typewriter](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-10-typewriter/) (10) saves progress, and lets you type more than 1 page of content.
-   [Screensaver](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-12-screensavers/) (12) works on more screen sizes, including phones.
-   [Synth](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-14-bytebeat-synth/) (14) looks better on a phone-sized display.
-   [Stuff.md](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-23-packing/) (23) has an example from the database
-   [Timelapse](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-23-packing/) (24) has a partial video
-   [Speed Reading](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-29-speed-reading/) (29) works better on a phone. It also saves your progress.
-   [Music of the Spheres](https://blog.za3k.com/hack-a-day-day-30-music-of-the-celestial-spheres/) (30) works on a phone. It’s also louder.
