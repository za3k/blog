Thursday’s project was [Hack-A-Clock](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/clock/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/clock/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day24_clock)). It is a decimal time clock, displaying the time in revolutionary french time (minus their weird calendar).

This is another “phone it in” project but I think it would have been okay with more accompanying explanation and better styling.
