[Hack-a-Day](https://za3k.com/hackaday) is my self-imposed challenge to do one project a day, for all of November.

Today's project was a simple platformer. I got something playable, but I wouldn't say it's to the point of actually being a game. Hopefully I'll have time to go back and finish it before the month is out.

I had a lot of fun making this one. I love visual stuff. You can play [online here](https://za3k.github.io/1d-platformer/) or view the source code [on github](https://github.com/za3k/1d-platformer).
