title: 'Hack-a-Day, Day 25: Go Screensaver'
---

Today I made a Go "screensaver".

You can see it [online here](https://za3k.github.io/go/screensaver.html). The source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/go).

Games are taken from OGS, and played real-time. Provided are a selection of 1000 random games from OGS, a popular Go server. Games play in real time, the same as when they were originally played.

I made this to have a screensaver for my mantel.

Hope you enjoy.
