<div class="entry-content">
<p>I made a new cryptosystem called OK-Mixnet. It has “perfect” security, as opposed to the usual pretty-good security. (Of course, it’s not magic–if your computer is hacked, the cryptosystem isn’t gonna protect your data). Despite the name, it’s not really a mixnet per se, it just similarly defends against SIGINT.</p>
<p>A writeup is here: <a href="https://za3k.com/ok-mixnet.md">https://za3k.com/ok-mixnet.md</a></p>
<p>The alpha codebase is here: <a href="https://github.com/za3k/ok-mixnet">https://github.com/za3k/ok-mixnet</a></p>
<p>Let me know if you’d like to join the open alpha. Email me your username and IP (you’ll need to forward a port).</p>
