<p>I <a href="https://blog.za3k.com/life-logging-in-2019/">write down everything I do.</a> </p>
<p>I transcribed my journals by hand. That is, I typed them up myself, instead of trying to use handwriting recognition or outsourcing to Mechanical Turk.</p>
<ul><li>I started on 2019-11-02, and finished today, 2020-11-20. That’s roughly one year. </li><li>The 15 journals transcribed go from 2011 to 2020, 10 years. The 2011-2015 period is sparser.</li><li>Of the 15 journals, 13 of them them I transcribed from the physical version. Two I had thrown out, because my old scanner was feed-through, and I had to destroy the spines to scan the books.</li><li>That’s 1779 pages total (small ones, these are pocket journals). It’s also 32,000 lines, and 164K words. The text is 1.1MB, the scanned PNG files are 12GB (12000 MB).</li><li>In general, it takes me 1 hour to transcribe the last week of notes. Going farther back is harder, partly because my handwriting gets more readable as time progresses (due at least as much to my choice of pen, as my neatness), and partly because I have a harder time guessing at poor handwriting without memory to fill it in, and partly because I didn’t use standard formats back then. </li><li>I do have exact numbers I could check, but a lower bound based on this rate is that was overall 90 hours of work. It probably didn’t take more than twice that.</li></ul>
