<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Yesterday’s project was <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/battle/">Hack-A-Battle</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/battle/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day21_battle">source</a>). It’s two dueling music visualizers (sound warning!). Red vs blue. As each hits the other with bullets, they lose heath. As a band takes damage, it gets dimmer and quieter. Eventually one band will win out and be the only one playing.</p>

<p>I thought this was a cool idea, but I’m not really happy with the implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a little laggy, especially when explosions happen.</li>
<li>It’s probably a little too fast of a battle.</li>
<li>I wanted to the things coming out to actually be linked to a music visualizer, which I almost had time to do.</li>
<li>It would have been better if the “bands” took turns playing instead of both going at once, for the poor listener.</li>
<li>It requires a fairly big display, and beefy computer/phone. It doesn’t work well on a small screen at all.</li>
<li>I wasn’t super pleased with the code. It was so-so</li>
<li>I wanted you to be able to upload your own songs and duel a friend</li>
</ul>
