I tested with [one tile](https://blog.za3k.com/garden-signs-on-wall-tiles/). Now I made signs for my whole garden.

To start, I covered each marble tile in painter’s tape.

Then, I used double-stick tape to attach labels.

I cut out the words using an x-acto knife, and removed the paper and cut-out portion.

I spray painted them. I chose a higher-contrast color because of my one-tile test.

I peeled off the tape, and voilà:

Lessons learned:

-   Doing a test tile was a good idea
-   It takes almost as much time to peel out the letters as cut it. I was thinking of using a laser cutter to speed things up, but it could at most halve the manual labor.
-   You should switch x-acto blades more often than you think.
-   I should have spent even more time on an easy-to-cut font. The “a”, “e”, and “r” are too hard in this font.
