In 2022, 2023, and 2024, I did "Hack-a-Day", a challenge to myself to do one project a day for all of November. It's vaguely modelled off [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/), a challenge to write a book in November.

This year, I completed 21 projects in 30 days. On average, I worked 7.5 hours per project. My expenses for the month were $130, divided over only three projects--ingredients for Project L.E.M.B.A.S. ($85), aluminium to mill for soma cubes ($28), and missing parts for my TODO whiteboard ($19).
