<div class="entry-content">
<p>It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!</p>
<p>Today’s project is <a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/line/">Hack-A-Line</a> (<a href="https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/line/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/za3k/day13_line">source</a>). Hack-A-Line is a 5-in-a-row game for two players. You play online against each other by sharing a link.</p>

<p>I’m okay with this one, except that there’s one really bad display bug that kind of ruins it. I’m starting to develop a list of projects where I might want to go back and fix something after this month.</p>
<p>I skipped yesterday because I needed a break.</p>
