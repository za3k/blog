title: 'Rear Lights'
---

I drive a 1998 Toyota Corolla. For reference, here is a guide to the rear lights.

Note that the brake light also serves as a tail light, which makes it easy to tell if it's out even solo.

To test the backup/reverse light, you need to put the car in reverse (but can keep the brake down). This needs a second person.

All the rear lights are easy and cheap to replace. (The front lights, only cheap.)
