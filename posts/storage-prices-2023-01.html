<p>I did a survey of the cost of buying hard drives (of all sorts), microsd/sd, USB sticks, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, and tape media (for tape drives).</p>
<p>I excluded used/refurbished options. Multi-packs (5 USB sticks) were excluded, except for optical media like CD-ROMs. Seagate drives were excluded because Seagate has a poor reputation.</p>
<p>Here are the <strong>2023-01 results</strong>: <a href="https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2023-01.sc.txt">https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2023-01.sc.txt</a></p>

<p>Per TB, the options are (from cheapest to most expensive):</p>
<ul>
<li>Tape media (LTO-8) at $4.52/TB, but I recommend against it. A tape drive is about $1,600 (twice that new). That’s a breakeven at 150-300TB. Also, the world is down to one tape drive manufacturer, so you may end up screwed in the future.</li>
<li>3.5″ internal spinning hard drives, at $15.00/TB. Currently the best option is 8TB drives.</li>
<li>Optical media, at $16.71/TB. 25GB blu-ray disks are cheapest.</li>
<li>3.5″ external hard drives, at $17.75/TB. Currently the best option is 18TB drives.</li>
<li>2.5″ portable spinning hard drives, at $22.00/TB. Currently the best option is 5TB drives.</li>
<li></li>
<li>SSD drives, at $42-$46/TB. Best option is 1TB.</li>
<li>USB sticks, at $59/TB. Best option is 128GB sticks.</li>
<li>MicroSD cards, at $62/TB. Best option is 512GB cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes since the last survey (4 months ago):</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon’s search improved. Less refurbished drives and sponsored listings.</li>
<li><strong>Spinning drives</strong>: 22TB 3.5″ drives became available</li>
<li><strong>Spinning drives</strong>: Prices for the previous cheapest option (4TB) rose, making 8TB the new cheap option.</li>
<li><strong>SSDs</strong>: Prices dropped by about 30%.</li>
<li><strong>MicroSD/SD</strong>: Prices dropped slightly.</li>
<li><strong>Optical</strong>: The cheapest option (25GB blu-ray) dropped 30%.</li>
<li><strong>Optical</strong>: I stopped gathering data on the cost of BR-RE</li>
<li><strong>Tape</strong>: LTO-7 tape drives are now available used, halving the break-even point on tape.</li>
</ul>
