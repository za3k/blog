Hack-a-Day is a challenge to complete ~30 fun new projects in 30 days. In my case, I aimed for 20, because I knew I was getting a job and moving. I just barely made it with this last entry, a collaboration with nsh.

Music of the Spheres lets you hear songs on different tonal scales. Listen to the warped melodies. Watch the pretty planets orbit.

Demo is [here](https://za3k.github.io/ha3k-30-musicofspheres/), code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/ha3k-30-musicofspheres).
