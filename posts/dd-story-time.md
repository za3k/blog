In my recent campaign, I had a handout for the players. I took it out, and on a whim, I thought *« a handout is boring* ».

I tore it into quarters in front of their eyes. I wrote on back of the handout pieces “**5**“, “**10**“, “**15**“, “**20**“. *“Make me an investigation check,”* I intoned in my best DM voice. “*I will grant you any pieces under your roll.*“

They got 23, so I gave them all four scraps. They taped it back together and got the whole handout.

And they remembered that handout. They told players *in other campaigns* about the handout.
