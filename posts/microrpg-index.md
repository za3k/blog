title: Ultimate Book MicroRPG Index
---

I got a copy of [The Ultimate Micro-RPG Book](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Micro-RPG-Book-Tabletop-Games-ebook/dp/B084GB3X4Z). It's a nice book that has 40 different one-page and two-page RPGs by a wide variety of authors.

I'm running a local event where we play a new game, and I wanted to quickly find which RPGs in the book are suitable for the number of players at the table. Unfortunately the indices at the back do not include this option.

Here's my [custom index](https://za3k.com/archive/microrpg/) for the book. You can print it easily if you want (9 pages, one for each of 1-9 players).
