<div class="entry-content">
<p>I added a <a href="https://za3k.com/software.md">software section</a> to my website. It lists all the software Iâ€™ve made over the years (well not all of it, but what I think is most useful to others).</p>
<p>I updated the <a href="https://za3k.com/archived.html">archive</a> page as well, mostly to remove the software that was there. As usual, I try to make sure all links to my website are good forever.</p>
