Today's project was one I've been wanting for a while--a way for people to send me files.

[![upload.za3k.com](upload-za3k-com.png)](https://upload.za3k.com)

There were two components -- a web form where you can upload things, and a server that you send the things to. Both were fairly easy.

You can now send me things at [upload.za3k.com](https://upload.za3k.com)
