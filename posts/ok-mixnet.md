I made a new cryptosystem called OK-Mixnet. It has “perfect” security, as opposed to the usual pretty-good security. (Of course, it’s not magic–if your computer is hacked, the cryptosystem isn’t gonna protect your data). Despite the name, it’s not really a mixnet per se, it just similarly defends against SIGINT.

A writeup is here: [https://za3k.com/ok-mixnet.md](https://za3k.com/ok-mixnet.md)

The alpha codebase is here: [https://github.com/za3k/ok-mixnet](https://github.com/za3k/ok-mixnet)

Let me know if you’d like to join the open alpha. Email me your username and IP (you’ll need to forward a port).
