[Hack-a-Day](https://za3k.com/hackaday) is my self-imposed challenge to do one project a day, for all of November.

Today I took my previous golf game, and turned it into a little idle game. It takes about 30 minutes to finish.

You can play [online here](https://za3k.github.io/idle-golf/) or view the source code [on github](https://github.com/za3k/idle-golf).
