<div class="entry-content">
<p>I did a survey of the cost of buying hard drives (of all sorts), CDs, DVDs, Blue-rays, and tape media (for tape drives).</p>
<p>Here are the <strong>2020-01 results</strong>: <a href="https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2020-01.sc.txt">https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2020-01.sc.txt</a><br/>2019-07: <a href="https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2019-07.sc.txt">https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2019-07.sc.txt</a><br/>2018-10: <a href="https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2018-10.sc.txt">https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2018-10.sc.txt</a><br/>2018-06: <a href="https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2017-06.sc.txt">https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2017-06.sc.txt</a><br/>2018-01: <a href="https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2017-01.sc.txt">https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2017-01.sc.txt</a></p>
<p>Changes this year</p>
<ul><li>I excluded Seagate drives (except where they’re the only drives in class)</li><li>Amazon’s search got much worse, and they started having listings for refurbished drives</li><li>Corrected paper archival density, added photographic film</li><li>Added SSDs (both 2.5″ and M.2 formats)</li><li>Prices did not go up or down significantly in the last 6 months.</li></ul>
<p>Some conclusions that are useful to know</p>
<ul><li>The cheapest option is tape media, but tape reader/writers for LTO 6, 7, and 8 are very expensive.</li><li>The second-cheapest option is to buy external hard drives, and then open the cases and take out the hard drives. This gives you reliable drives with no warrantee.</li><li>Blu-ray and DVD are more expensive than buying hard drives</li></ul>
