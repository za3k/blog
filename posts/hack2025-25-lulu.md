[Hack-a-Day](https://za3k.com/hackaday) is my self-imposed challenge to do one project a day, for all of November.

This is my first exception this year - a project that took TWO days (despite best efforts). About 15 hours.

I wrote a program which can take a PDF, and then get it self-published (through [lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/)), and sent to my house.

Source code is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/lulu). This project was co-written with AI, with Claude doing the heavy lifting.

I learned some Playwright along the way.

Expect to see me posting about a bunch of wacky books in the future. Today's is reasonable -- just my [recent cookbook update](https://blog.za3k.com/cookbook-2/)
