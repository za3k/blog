It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Crop](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/crop/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/crop/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day18_crop)). It crops an image to a fixed size.

I got help from several people on the CSS, thanks to instantly sharing my work via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) from my laptop. Thanks people! Thanks ngrok!

Today’s project was in anticipation of showing off what I did at the end of the month. I want a small thumbnail for each project.
