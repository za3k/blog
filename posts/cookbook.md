I filled up my paper notebook I use to keep recipes. I typed it up and edited it. It’s available for free online, as a .txt or .pdf file: [https://github.com/za3k/cookbook/releases](https://github.com/za3k/cookbook/releases)

Note that most of these recipes are from online or printed sources. Some are written by me, family, or friends.
