Hereâ€™s every video game I played in 2024!

- (2/5) Aground: I barely remember playing this, and I spent maybe two days on it.
- (0/5) Alien Cat: I paid something like $0.50 for this game and it wasn't worth it.
- (4/5) Autonauts: (Already reviewed)
- (2/5) Belatro
- Can't Stop: Okay, I wrote this one, but I played it too.
- (3/5) Chained Together
- (4/5) Clustertruck
- (3/5) Conquest of Go: Really fun if you like Go. Not much to do after you finish it, but an amazing variety of modes, with a lot of effort put into each. The thing it does best is a smooth progression of difficulties.
- (2/5) Corponation: This was a fun vibe
- (3/5) Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood: I kept zoning out for the gameplay, but the art is just fantastic.
- (3/5) Dave the Diver: A game with hundreds of devs trying (and succeeding) at an indie feel.
- (4/5) DROD
- (1/5) Escape Room: The Seasons (phone)
- (2/5) Factorio (Space Age update): This is a really good update, I'm just Factorio-d out for my life, maybe.
- (4/5) Game-time Glizzys: A silly, low-budget game about making hot dogs that's weirdly compelling and intense.
- (1/5) Hand of Fate 2: I dunno, it was okay?
- (4/5) Hohokum: Really fun. Appreciated the lack of achievements.
- (2/5) House Flipper: Fun, then grindy.
- (3/5) House Flipper 2: Nice improvements over the first.
- (4/5) Hyperrogue: I don't play this game a lot, but I just keep coming back to it for quick games, year after year. A lot of staying power.
- (1/5) Idle Games: There are some okay idle games out there, but I didn't play any this year. Instead, I played:
    - (1/5) Advent Incremental
    - (1/5) Apex Machina

    - (3/5) Clicker Ultimate
    - (1/5) Wigmaker
- (3/5) IFO
- (3/5) Inscryption: I had lots of fun when it came out. Replaying was okay too. It was really hard to figure out how to reset!

- (0/5) Tendy
- (3/5) The Farmer Has Been Replaced
- (1/5) Triga: I think it was too hard for me. Blame this one on me.
- (5/5) UFO50
