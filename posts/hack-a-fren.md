title: 'Hack-a-Day, Day 22: AI Friend'
---

Today I mostly slept, but while I was awake I tried making an ai friend/boyfriend as an experiment. I spent a lot of time getting Pygmalion (an LLM based on LLaMA-2, which specializes in roleplay and narration) to run. At the end, it was underwhelming, at least what I could run locally. I get the impression the full version is a lot better.

Although this was a failure, Pygmalion was sponsored by [spicychat.ai](https://spicychat.ai/), which I found to be much better for creating AI companions. However be warned--the site is in general very NSFW.
