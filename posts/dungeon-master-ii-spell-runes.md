I’m a fan of the game [Dungeon Master II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_II:_The_Legend_of_Skullkeep) (1993). In fact, I’m planning to get a tattoo of the rune system. So I looked around for a reference image. Here’s one from the game manual:

This looked like a nice one, because it shows the game graphics:

But there’s one problem–an entire row of runes is missing. Here’s a corrected one I made.
