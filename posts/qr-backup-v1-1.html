<p><a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup">qr-backup</a> v1.1 is released. qr-backup is a <strong>command-line Linux program</strong>. You can use it to back up a file as a series of QR codes. You can restore the QR codes using a webcam or scanner, and get back the original file.</p>

<p>The main features of qr-backup are ease-of-use and futureproofing (restore does not require qr-backup).</p>
<p>Please report any bugs <a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup/issues">on github</a>. Once this is stable, I will do the first pip/package manager release. To test the alpha, check out the <a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup">latest code</a> using git.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md">USAGE</a> and <em>extensive</em> <a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>New features in v1.1:</p>
<ul><li>Feature complete. New features are unlikely to be added. Future efforts will focus on quality, GUIs, and porting.</li><li>restore using qr-backup. Previously, the only restore was a bash one-liner (which still works).<ul><li><code>qr-backup --restore</code> restores using the webcam</li><li><code>qr-backup --restore IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE</code> restores from scanned images</li></ul></li><li>After generating a PDF backup, qr-backup automatically does a digital test of the restore process</li><li>Erasure coding. Lose up to 30% of QRs and restore will still work, as long as you are using qr-backup to restore</li><li>Increased code density, which about cancels out the erasure coding.</li><li>Back up directories and files. qr-backup makes a .tar file for you</li><li>Option to use password protection (encryption)</li><li>Option to print multiple copies of every QR code</li><li>Option to randomize order of QR codes</li><li>Optionally print extra cover sheet instructions on how to restore. For long-term archivists.</li><li>Option to add custom notes and labels to each page</li><li>Improved support for using qr-backup in a pipe</li><li>Various bugfixes</li><li>See <a href="https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup/blob/master/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a> for complete details</li></ul>
<p>P.S. As a special request, if anyone is on OS X, let me know if it works for you?</p>
