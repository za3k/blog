[Hack-a-Day](https://za3k.com/hackaday) is my self-imposed challenge to do one project a day, for all of November.

Today's project was mini-golf. I've seen these online, and I thought it was an easy problem (I was mostly right).

It turns out finding the intersection of two lines is really hard, though! It kind of seems easy mathematically, but in practice it's really fiddly with a lot of edge cases. Reflecting is also harder to figure out on a computer than by hand.

My little demo only has one level, but the hard part was the engine -- adding 8 more holes would be pretty easy, I think. There's no hilly slopes or other special features in this verion.

I stayed up too late finishing this one, heh. You can play [online here](https://za3k.github.io/hack-a-golf/) or view the source code [on github](https://github.com/za3k/hack-a-golf).
