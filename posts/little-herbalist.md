Today I wrote a game called **Little Herbalist**. Or at least, I started to.

I'm pretty pleased with what I have--random ingredients appearing in various colors, which you can add to a brewing potion. The potion changes colors based on what ingredients you've added.

It's definitely not a complete game, and I'd like to work on it again another day.

You can play the unfinished game [online](https://za3k.github.io/little-herbalist/) or read the source code [on github](https://github.com/za3k/little-herbalist).
