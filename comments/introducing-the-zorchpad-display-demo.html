<p>Very cool idea. I was imagining form factors, and was thinking briefly about somehow having a sort of laptop arrangement where an e-ink screen is visible through glass when it is closed and in some kind of “protective storage mode”, and then visible directly from “the proper side of the e-ink screen” after it opens up. This is probably impossible using default hardware options, but searching around to confirm this lead to some interesting links and unusual design demos.</p>
<p>Here’s ~12 year old thread from someone who wants a computer to use in an off grid cabin.<br/>

<p>Here is a 2023 video about the revived product “GVUIDO” (pronounced Guido) optimized for musicians where part of the UI involves covering a light sensor.<br/>

<p>One thing that struck me is that a lot of people might want a Xorchpad to stick INSIDE a larger system (out in nature? as part of a science package?) that might install a rugged solar panel and battery. Then a small USB-C cord might provide a Xorchpad inside the unit with power, and want some intelligence to come out of the same cord, in exchange?</p>
<p>I’m not sure if a USB-C is consistent with the vision, however. Maybe the “minimum power” for that is far above the “maximim power” that would not blow the Sourcepad’s circuits?</p>

<p>Try using numbers, instead of words! It works better for comparing power usage.</p>
<p>The “low-power computer” someone wants from 12 years ago should be 3W. The Zorchpad is designed to run at 0.001W.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what GVUIDO has to do with anything, was there a reason you linked that?</p>
<p>The Zorchpad could easily be powered by any standard cable, yes. But if you need a larger system to power it, you’re missing the point.</p>
<p>“Blowing circuits” is not a correct intuition for designing low-power electronics. Go learn about Ohm’s Law!</p>
