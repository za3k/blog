It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Paste][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). You can upload text and share it with others.

Today’s project was an easy one, because I was busy. Took an hour or two.
