[![roasted](https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/roasted-300x264.jpg)](https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/roasted.jpg)Here’s how you make roasted chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans):

1.  Set the oven to 400F.
2.  Drain and empty a can or so of chickpeas into a collander and wash them
3.  Dry the chickpeas (this is the hard step). I use paper towels, but I haven’t figured out a way to not use a billion of them.
4.  Put them in a short pan in the oven and cover them in olive oil. Toss them some with your hands to get them coated.
5.  Cook for 20-30 minutes, shaking the pan so everything turns every 10 minutes. I like them crispy so I do 30 minutes.
6.  Take them out and transfer them to a bowl. Add spices. I like salt, garlic powder, and pepper.
