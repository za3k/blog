It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Line](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/line/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/line/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day13_line)). Hack-A-Line is a 5-in-a-row game for two players. You play online against each other by sharing a link.

I’m okay with this one, except that there’s one really bad display bug that kind of ruins it. I’m starting to develop a list of projects where I might want to go back and fix something after this month.

I skipped yesterday because I needed a break.
