It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Stats][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It displays web traffic statistics about Hack-A-Day.

The original point of the project was to show some nice graphs in d3, as an effort to teach myself d3. But halfway through I got unbearably bored by “show a bunch of stats” as a project, so no d3. Whoops! You win some you lose some.
