I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble getting Minecraft Forge to run headless. They have a friendly installer option that I just can‚Äôt use in my situation, but one of the devs seems actively hostile around providing help to headless servers, so I didn‚Äôt bother asking forge for help. I thought I‚Äôd write up what I had to do to get things working. As a warning, it requires some local work; you can‚Äôt do everything headless with these directions.

I‚Äôm running Minecraft 1.6.4, with the latest version of forge for that, 9.11.1.965.

1.  Locally, download and start the minecraft client for the correct version at least once. Not sure if you‚Äôll need to ‚Äòplay online‚Äô or not. If you have the current installer, you need to make a new profile with the correct minecraft version and play that.
2.  Copy ~/.minecraft/libraries to the headless machine.
3.  Download¬†forge (the installer¬†version, not the universal) from¬†[http://files.minecraftforge.net/][1].¬†The non-adly version is the little star for non-interactive use.
4.  Run
    
    java -jar forge-1.6.4-9.11.1.965-installer.jar --installServer
    
5.  Delete the installer, you don‚Äôt need it any more.
6.  Install any mods you want to the ‚Äòmods‚Äô directory, edit server.properties, etc. Normal server setup.
7.  To execute the server, run the file indicated in the installer. In my case, I run
    
    java -jar¬†minecraftforge-universal-1.6.4-9.11.1.965-v164-pregradle.jar nogui
    

Alternatively, you can install the entire server locally and copy it over.

    4am installs of servers is hard, and trying to follow the Forge wiki which is inaccurate at best is hard.  
    You got me from dead brick to running box in ten minutes. Thank you.

    Thanks so much! I‚Äôve been looking for these steps for a while, and finally found something that works. Would have been first prize if it could be used along with a GUI frontend like mcmyadmin, but oh well üôÇ

    Same here. Searched all over found yours and running in moments. My kids have been hooked on mods and wanted a server. I have VMware and can spin up a linux box up in moments. This was so easy. Thanks.

    this is so typical of the linux community. really. And I am a developer with 20 years experience, I hate the Linux community.
