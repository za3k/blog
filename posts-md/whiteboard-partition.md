I wanted a partition to divide my room, and I had a whiteboard sitting around. I sawed it into three parts, and connected them with hinges:

hinge (back)

I’m a little embarrassed at having done all this, since it was obvious as soon as I started the partition was way too short to work. I figured I’d still get some experience woodworking (this is my first project). Here’s where it went:
