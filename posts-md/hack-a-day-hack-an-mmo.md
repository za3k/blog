It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

This is November 30th, so this will be the last project.

Today’s project is [Hack-An-MMO][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It’s a small collaborative art RPG. You can draw people, places, and things to populate the tiny world. Have fun!
