We made a blast furnace, following David Gingery’s [The Charcoal Foundry](https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Foundry-Build-Metal-Working/dp/1878087002). Here are some pictures of the firing process. We haven’t melted or cast any metal yet.

Slow initial burn to drive out most of the water

You can tell we’re trained professionals by the fan setup

Blast furnace meat is best meat
