Today I got a variety of modern A.I. tools to work in [a python library][1]. This one is mostly install instructions, but it was useful for me, at least.

I took a day off after.

My conclusions were:

-   Speech synthesis runs at 400x realtime on CPU.
-   Speech recognition runs at 0.4x realtime on CPU, 60x realtime on GPU.
-   Generating chat at 0.05x – 0.5x realtime (3-30 wpm) on GPU.

I didn’t get image generation working on my allotted time.
