It’s no longer november, but I’m still doing a project a day. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Yesterday’s project was [Hack-A-TV-Guide](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/tvguide/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/tvguide/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day33_tvguide)). It’s a TV Guide generated from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). I got the idea from having written [isrickandmortyout.com](http://isrickandmortyout.com/). Why not do the same thing, but for every show?

I’m going to call this one a flop. There’s a good version of this project, but I ran out of time. Basically all it does is display info about a show, which is not very useful.
