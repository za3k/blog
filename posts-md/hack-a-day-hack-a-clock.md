Thursday’s project was [Hack-A-Clock][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It is a decimal time clock, displaying the time in revolutionary french time (minus their weird calendar).

This is another “phone it in” project but I think it would have been okay with more accompanying explanation and better styling.
