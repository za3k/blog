[![alt:2015-06-28-021223_683x381](https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-021223_683x381.jpg)](https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-021223_683x381.jpg)I added an IRC server to my growing list of services. You can access it at:

-   irc.za3k.com
-   Port 6667

Or via the [webchat](https://irc.za3k.com/?channels=forum), which I recommend.

I’ve also recently updated my [home page](https://za3k.com/) to look much prettier, in imitation of a [Computer Craft cheatsheet](https://za3k.com/computercraft_reference.html) I’ve been working on.
