[![2015-06-28-021223_683x381](https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-021223_683x381.jpg)][1]I added an IRC server to my growing list of services. You can access it at:

-   irc.za3k.com
-   Port 6667

Or via the [webchat][2], which I recommend.

I’ve also recently updated my [home page][3] to look much prettier, in imitation of a [Computer Craft cheatsheet][4] I’ve been working on.
