It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s (catch-up) project is [Hack-A-Homepage][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). You can enter various information about yourself, such as links to your social media, and make your own little homepage.

This one took about another hour. I think it’s okay, but today was definitely a “do the numbers” game to catch up. Tomorrow I want to do something more fun and new.
