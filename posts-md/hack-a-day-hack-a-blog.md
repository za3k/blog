It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is the [Hack-A-Blog](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/blog/). ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/blog/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day03_blog)).

Check out the link above to try out the live demo. I’m proud of getting this one done in time. I think the next days will be easier, as I figured some things out already.
