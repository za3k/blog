Sometimes Linux wants to open files. I mostly use the command line, so I wrote some helper programs to open things in terminals.

-   `open-text-file` opens your default text editor in a terminal. I set it as my program to open all text files.
-   `open-directory` opens a terminal with that working directory. I set it as my program to open all directories.

Theyâ€™re both available in [short-programs][1]. Both default to xterm.
