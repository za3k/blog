-   [Year 0](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/e3nb2r/longterm_reliability_testing/)Â â€“ I filled 10 32-GB Kingston flash drives with random data.
-   [Year 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/lwgsdr/research_flash_media_longevity_testing_1_year/)Â â€“ Tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drive 1 with the same data.
-   [Year 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/tb26cy/flash_media_longevity_testing_2_years_later/)Â â€“ Tested drive 2, zero bit rot. Re-tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drives 1-2 with the same data.
-   Year 3 â€“ Tested drive 3, zero bit rot. Re-tested drives 1-2, zero bit rot. Re-wrote drives 1-3 with the same data.

This year they were stored in a box on my shelf.

Will report back in 1 more year when I test the fourth ðŸ™‚
