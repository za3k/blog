I did a survey of the cost of buying hard drives (of all sorts), microsd/sd, USB sticks, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, and tape media (for tape drives).

I excluded used/refurbished options. Multi-packs (5 USB sticks) were excluded, except for optical media like CD-ROMs. Seagate drives were excluded because Seagate has a poor reputation.

Here are the **2023-01 results**: [https://za3k.com/archive/storage-2023-01.sc.txt][1]

Per TB, the options are (from cheapest to most expensive):

-   Tape media (LTO-8) at $4.52/TB, but I recommend against it. A tape drive is about $1,600 (twice that new). That’s a breakeven at 150-300TB. Also, the world is down to one tape drive manufacturer, so you may end up screwed in the future.
-   3.5″ internal spinning hard drives, at $15.00/TB. Currently the best option is 8TB drives.
-   Optical media, at $16.71/TB. 25GB blu-ray disks are cheapest.
-   3.5″ external hard drives, at $17.75/TB. Currently the best option is 18TB drives.
-   2.5″ portable spinning hard drives, at $22.00/TB. Currently the best option is 5TB drives.

-   SSD drives, at $42-$46/TB. Best option is 1TB.
-   USB sticks, at $59/TB. Best option is 128GB sticks.
-   MicroSD cards, at $62/TB. Best option is 512GB cards.

Changes since the last survey (4 months ago):

-   Amazon’s search improved. Less refurbished drives and sponsored listings.
-   **Spinning drives**: 22TB 3.5″ drives became available
-   **Spinning drives**: Prices for the previous cheapest option (4TB) rose, making 8TB the new cheap option.
-   **SSDs**: Prices dropped by about 30%.
-   **MicroSD/SD**: Prices dropped slightly.
-   **Optical**: The cheapest option (25GB blu-ray) dropped 30%.
-   **Optical**: I stopped gathering data on the cost of BR-RE
-   **Tape**: LTO-7 tape drives are now available used, halving the break-even point on tape.
