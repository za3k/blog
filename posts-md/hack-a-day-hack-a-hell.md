It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Hell][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It’s a bullet hell game combined with a music visualizer.

I’m happy with this one, although it took way too long given yesterday’s project! I keep thinking I’ll be able to modify or re-use things quickly, and it’s not true.

P.S. Taking the next day or two off for thanksgiving
