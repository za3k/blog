It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-An-Asteroid](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/asteroid/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/asteroid/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day07_asteroid)). It’s an asteroids clone with four levels.

I’m pretty happy with this as my first “visual” game. I made it in Unity3D.
