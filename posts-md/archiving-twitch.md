Install jq and youtube-dl

Get a list of the last 100 URLs:

curl https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/channels/${TWITCH\_USER}/videos?broadcasts=true&limit=100 | 
  jq -r '.videos\[\].url' > past\_broadcasts.txt

Save them locally:

youtube-dl -a past\_broadcasts.txt -o "%(upload\_date)s.%(title)s.%(id)s.%(ext)s"

Did it. youtube-dl is smart enough to avoid re-downloading videos it already has, so as long as you run this often enough (I do daily), you should avoid losing videos before theyâ€™re deleted.

Thanks [jrayhawk][1] for the API info.
