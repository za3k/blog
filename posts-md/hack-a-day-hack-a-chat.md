It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Chat](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/chat/). ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/chat/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day04_chat)). It’s a free web chat for anyone that goes to the website.

Check out the link above to try out the live demo.

So far, not much easier. Another 8-hour day. I was hoping to do something with WebRTC today, but I didn’t get to it.
