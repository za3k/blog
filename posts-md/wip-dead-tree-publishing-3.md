Compared with [last update](https://blog.za3k.com/wip-dead-tree-publishing-2/ "WIP: Dead Tree Publishing 2"),  the Dead Tree Publishing website is looking nicer.

Looking better

It’s served over HTTPS now (not needed for security, but it puts people at ease and enabled Chrome’s autocomplete) and you can order multiple books at a time.

Other than some more visual improvements, the main thing missing is proper detection of page size — my server doesn’t understand about page margins, so it things books are bigger than they really are.
