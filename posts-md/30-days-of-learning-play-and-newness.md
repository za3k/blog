So I’ve decided on my next project! I’m going to spend a month learning new things. Unlike hack-a-day, where the focus was mostly on doing something every day, here I’m trying to cultivate a different attitude. So the following are all encouraged:

-   Being curious about stuff
-   Getting distracted
-   Having fun
-   New experiences
-   Being goofy, even if I don’t “learn” anything from goof experiences
-   Naps
-   Hanging with other people

And these are discouraged:

-   Completionism
-   “Grinding” through a nonfiction book I’m not that into
-   Rigorously writing up everything
-   TV and other mindless activities
-   (tentatively) reading?
