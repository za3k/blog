-   [Emperical Zendo](https://za3k.com/archive/emperical_zendo.md), a semi-competitive game for 3-8 players based on the icehouse game Zendo. Vaguely based on rants by Bayesians.
-   [Logic Potions](https://za3k.com/archive/logic_potions.md), a competitive game about deductive logic and making new rules for 2-4 players. Actual gameplay quickly gets complicated as players add more rules about brewing potions. Inspired by “Imaginary Go Fish” and “Emperical Zendo”.
-   [Deadly Education RPG](https://za3k.com/archive/deadly.md), a traditional pen+paper RPG game based on Naomi Novik’s “Deadly Education”. Reading the book is not required.

All three are untested as of posting.
