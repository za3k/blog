It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s (catch-up) project is [Hack-A-Link](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/link), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day02_link)). You can enter a long link, and it will be shortened.

This one was also pretty easy. About an hour.
