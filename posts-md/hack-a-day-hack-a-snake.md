It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Snake][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). Yesterday I wrote a [game where an AI plays snake][4]. Today I thought, hey, I should release that with keyboard controls so people can just play Snake.
