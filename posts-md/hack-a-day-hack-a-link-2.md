It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Wednesday’s project was [Hack-A-Link 2][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It’s an open link directory.

This was very much a “phone it in” project. I do think it could have been better if I had added descriptions, too.
