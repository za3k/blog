It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Dictionary](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/dictionary/) ([demo](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/dictionary/), [source](https://github.com/za3k/day08_dictionary)). It looks up words.

OK, I’ll be honest. I’m phoning this one in. I needed a break.
