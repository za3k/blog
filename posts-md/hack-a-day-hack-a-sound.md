It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Sound][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It’s a small soundboard.

You can:

-   Play 25 built-in samples
-   Record your own samples with your mic
-   Play samples directly, or record them on up to 4 tracks
-   Have tracks play one time only, or loop
-   Adjust the alignment of tracks
-   Use a keyboard or mouse
-   (Mobile not supported)

Have fun. I think this was a pretty good toy.
