[Year 0][1] ‚Äì I filled 10 32-GB Kingston flash drives with random data.  
[Year 1][2] ‚Äì Tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Re-wrote the drive with the same data.  
Year 2 ‚Äì Re-tested drive 1, zero bit rot. Tested drive 2, zero bit rot. Re-wrote both with the same data.

They have been stored in a box on my shelf, with a 1-month period in a moving van (probably below freezing) this year.

Will report back in 1 more year when I test the third üôÇ

FAQs:

-   Q: Why didn‚Äôt you test more kinds of drives?  
    A: Because I don‚Äôt have unlimited energy, time and money :). I encourage you to!
-   Q: You know you powered the drive by reading it, right?  
    A: Yes, that‚Äôs why I wrote 10 drives to begin with. We want to see how something works if left unpowered for 1 year, 2 years, etc.
-   Q: What drive model is this?  
    A: The drive tested was ‚ÄúKingston Digital DataTraveler SE9 32GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive (DTSE9H/32GBZ)‚Äù from Amazon, model DTSE9H/32GBZ, barcode 740617206432, WO# 8463411X001, ID 2364, bl 1933, serial id 206432TWUS008463411X001005. It was not used for anything previously‚ÄìI bought it just for this test.
-   Q: Which flash type is this model?  
    A: We don‚Äôt know. If you do know, please tell me.
-   Q: What data are you testing with?  
    A: ([Repeatable][3]) randomly generated bits
-   Q: What filesystem are you using? / Doesn‚Äôt the filesystem do error correction?  
    A: I‚Äôm writing data directly to the drive using Linux‚Äôs block devices.
