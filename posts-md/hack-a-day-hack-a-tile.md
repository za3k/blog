It’s november, and I’ve decided this month that I’m going to do 30 projects in 30 days. It’s an all-month hack-a-thon!

Today’s project is [Hack-A-Tile][1] ([demo][2], [source][3]). It’s a tile-matching game like dominos.

Hack-A-Tile is based on mathematical [Wang tiles][5]. It was very tempting to call it Hack-A-Wang.

If I update it, I would

-   Zoom out as you go. I think that would look cool!
-   Animate shifting over. Right now adding tiles on the top or left is visually confusing.
-   Change the tiles. These are fun mathematically, but not ideal for a game
-   Either add a maximum size, or some constraint to stop you just making one long line.
