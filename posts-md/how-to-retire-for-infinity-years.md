I retired at 31, and get asked about it sometimes. I wrote an article about how the math of retirement, which explains how I retired early (and some some extent, why). And of course, how and why you might want to as well.

I want to edit my finances articles, so this one is on my website instead: [https://za3k.com/finance/retire\_forever][1]

There will probably be some more finances articles to come soon.
