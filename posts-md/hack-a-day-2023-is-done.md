Hack-A-Day 2023 is complete. I did 20 projects in 30 days. Pretty good considering I got a new job and moved!

The overview of the month is [here][1] and highly recommended.

I plan to do a little more followup this year than last. Today’s last-minute fixes:

-   [Perquackey][3] (01) works on phones, tablets, and with the mouse. There’s an easter egg that displays any words you missed at the end.
-   [Typewriter][4] (10) saves progress, and lets you type more than 1 page of content.
-   [Screensaver][5] (12) works on more screen sizes, including phones.
-   [Synth][6] (14) looks better on a phone-sized display.
-   [Stuff.md][7] (23) has an example from the database
-   [Timelapse][8] (24) has a partial video
-   [Speed Reading][9] (29) works better on a phone. It also saves your progress.
-   [Music of the Spheres][10] (30) works on a phone. It’s also louder.
